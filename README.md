## Program Overview

This repository implements a comprehensive aerospace program for the design, certification, manufacture, and industrialisation of both aircraft and spacecraft vehicles.

### Program Charter

**Goal:** Design, certify, manufacture, and industrialise both vehicles.

**Success Criteria:**
- Flight‑ready prototypes
- Type certification/flight‑worthiness
- Serial ramp ≥ target rate
- Cost and safety KPIs met

**Standards Baseline:**
- Aircraft: ARP4754A/ARP4761, DO‑178C/DO‑254/DO‑160, AS9100, CS‑23/CS‑25 TBD
- Spacecraft: ECSS

### Stage Gates

SRR → MCR → PDR → CDR → TRR → PRR → ORR/EIS (aircraft) / FRR (spacecraft)

**V&V:** Requirements trace, HARA/SSA, FTA/FMEA, flight/ground test, conformity

```

### Key Interfaces

- Aircraft↔Spacecraft shared tech: materials, thermal, avionics, propulsion test assets
- Fleet layer supplies usage data and learning back into design

### Metrics

- Requirements coverage ≥ 99%
- Defect escape rate ≤ target
- Weight/mass budgets within margin
- Schedule variance ≤ target
- Cost per unit within target
