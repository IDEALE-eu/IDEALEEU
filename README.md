## TL;DR

**IDEALEEU** is a design and governance framework that turns ESG principles into **executable data contracts**, **workflows**, and **models**. It composes:

* **Reference services**: AMSDP and AAMMPP.
* **LLM layer**: provider‑agnostic gateway, RAG, guardrails.

**Outcomes**: auditable architectures, artifacts, and APIs that are reusable across programs.

**Tagline**: *Design responsibly. Prove it.*

---

## What IDEALE‑EU is

An ESG‑first, standards‑anchored framework to design next‑generation aerospace systems. It runs common LLMs via a provider‑neutral gateway with retrieval and guardrails. AMSDP and AAMMPP implement the framework as reference applications.

### Principles

* **ESG‑first**: evidence and metrics embedded in every artifact.
* **LLM‑enabled, model‑agnostic**: common models through a neutral gateway.
* **Standards‑anchored**: W3C VC, EPCIS, ASD S‑Series, ISO 15288.
* **Replaceable components**: stores, queues, and models are swappable.

---

## Positioning

### What it is

* A modular framework to **design responsibly**: architectures, models, and processes with ESG baked in.
* A set of **methods and data contracts** that make traceability, auditability, and lifecycle stewardship measurable.
* A **governance layer (MAL)** that encodes policy, risk controls, and evidence collection. *MAL = Master Application Layer/Logic; the PLC of each domain.*

### What it is not

* Not an aircraft or engine program; no product claims.
* Not a certification declaration; it **collects evidence** to support audits.
* Not a token or marketplace; commercial exchanges (A360Exchanges‑TT) are adjunct.

### ESG‑first pillars

1. **Environment**: decarbonization, energy efficiency, circularity, end‑of‑life.
2. **Social**: safety, human‑in‑the‑loop oversight, fair labor, accessibility.
3. **Governance**: transparency, explainability, anti‑tamper audit, supply‑chain trust.

### Value

* Unified digital thread from requirements to operations.
* Interoperability with industry standards; vendor‑neutral interfaces.
* **Responsible AI**: QPLC human‑governed automation with guardrails and evidence.
* Lower cost‑of‑change via versioned contracts and contract tests.

**Primary users**: OEMs, Tier‑n suppliers, MROs, regulators, research programs.

**Success metrics**: emissions impact, safety outcomes, interop conformance, audit completeness, time‑to‑evidence, total cost of quality.

## Component Taxonomy

Canonical classes and required passport claims.

### Classes (enum)

* `primary_structure`
* `secondary_structure`
* `installation_hardware`
* `information_hardware`
* `software`
* `model`
* `firmware`
* `sensor_antenna`

### Common identifiers

* `componentClass` (enum above)
* `componentType` (controlled vocab, e.g., `wing_spar`, `fastener_rivet`, `lru_fms`, `uC_firmware`, `fem_model`, `gnss_antenna`)
* `ciId` (configuration item ID)
* `partNumber` (canonical PN)
* `serialNumber` (where applicable)
* `effectivity` (tail numbers, lots, ranges)
* `asDesignedId` • `asPlannedId` • `asBuiltId`

### Minimum passport claims by class

**primary_structure**: material spec/process; ply/stack or forging route; heat/lot; NDI results; dimensional report; CoC/CoA; stress justification ref; surface treatment.

**secondary_structure**: material/finish; lot; inspection record; CoC; torque/installation spec if relevant.

**installation_hardware**: standard ref (NAS/MS/EN/AS); grip/size/finish; lot/heat; torque/bakeout spec; CoC.

**information_hardware**: LRU model/P/N; CPU/FPGA ID; interfaces; PSU range; firmware baseline; calibration certs; environmental quals (DO‑160/EN 2282) refs.

**software**: version; build hash; target LRU(s); SBOM (CycloneDX) and SLSA provenance; safety level target (e.g., DO‑178C A–E) and approval trail.

### Schemas and location

* `/00-PROGRAM/platform/schemas/components/common/Component.v1.json` (base)
* `/00-PROGRAM/platform/schemas/components/<class>/Passport.v1.json` (per class)
* `/00-PROGRAM/platform/schemas/bom/` (EBOM/MBOM/SerializedBOM)

---

## Circularity and MRO

**Distributed model**: MRO data and procedures live under each product portfolio path, not centrally.

Portfolio placement per product:

```
/0X-*/DOMAIN_INTEGRATION/PRODUCTS/<PRODUCT>/MODELS/<MODEL>/VERSION/<Qn>/MRO/
```

Service flow:

1. **Repair order / RMA** → intake and diagnostics.
2. **Repair / rework** under approved procedures.
3. **Tests / NDI** and functional verification.
4. **Requalification / recertification** with e‑signatures and SOF.
5. **Digital passport update** and configuration state update.
6. **Release** and **return to service**; order closure.

Minimum evidence: inspection reports; NDI results; calibration certificates; firmware/software baseline; **SBOM + provenance**; hours/cycles; EBOM/MBOM impact.

Supported operations: rotable pools; controlled cannibalization; redistribution across fleets; CCB approval; segregation of duties.

EPCIS events: *Commission*, *Observation*, *Transformation*, *Aggregation* for each transition.

---

## Data Contracts

* Contracts live in `/00-PROGRAM/platform/schemas` with versioned folders.
* Compatibility policy: **backward‑compatible minor**, **breaking major**.
* Contract tests run in CI; producers and consumers must pass.

Example: minimal material passport (JSON)

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "title": "MaterialPassport.v1",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["materialId", "lot", "issuer", "claims"],
  "properties": {
    "materialId": {"type": "string"},
    "lot": {"type": "string"},
    "issuer": {"type": "string", "format": "uri"},
    "claims": {"type": "object"}
  }
}
```

**New contracts**

* `/00-PROGRAM/platform/schemas/service/RMA.v1.json`

3. `POST /amsdp/v1/verify` with credential or reference.
4. `POST /amsdp/v1/revoke` to revoke.

## Sustainable energy systems for passenger aircraft

The platform tracks energy architectures across hydrogen, battery‑electric, SAF, and advanced propulsion. Summary below. A multi‑energy architecture proposal supports product roadmaps and certification planning.

| Energy Technology       | Description                                               | Target Aircraft / Routes        | Notes                                                                                           |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hydrogen**            | Hydrogen combustion or fuel cells. Water vapor emissions. | Short‑ to medium‑haul regional. | High infra and storage cost; lightweight tanks are the challenge. ZEROe timelines under review. |
| **Battery‑Electric**    | Batteries power electric motors.                          | Short‑haul ≤ ~500 km.           | Energy density limits; mass is the constraint. Fuel‑cell hybrids improve range.                 |
| **SAF**                 | Drop‑in bio/e‑fuels for current engines.                  | All types.                      | Scalable but feedstock‑limited. Best near‑term lever.                                           |
| **Advanced Propulsion** | Open Fan and new cores.                                   | Next‑gen fleets.                | >20% fuel‑burn/CO₂ reduction vs. current efficient engines. Compatible with SAF and future H₂.  |

**Ecosystem**

* Airports as energy hubs: ≥ 1 MW per charger; on‑site generation/storage recommended.
* Innovation: OEMs iterate platforms; startups drive radical concepts with certification risk.
* Policy: tighter CO₂ standards, jet‑fuel taxation, and R&D funding drive adoption.

**TFA mapping**: CQH, EEE, PPP, IIF.

### Technical Note: AMPAS (Multi‑Energy‑Agnostic Propulsion)

**Purpose**: integrate solid‑state batteries, liquid hydrogen (LH₂), SAF/e‑SAF, and high‑efficiency **Open Fan**.

**Functional sketch**

* **Takeoff**: batteries + H₂ fuel cells for peak power.
* **Climb/initial cruise**: transition to Open Fan on H₂ or SAF; electric assistance.
* **Cruise**: thermal mode (H₂ or SAF).
* **Descent/taxi**: partial regeneration and recharge.

**Controller**: **EDPICS** manages power flows, cryogenics, and G‑H₂ recirculation.

**Benefits**: up to **85%** CO₂/NOₓ reduction with SAF; **>95%** with green H₂. **20–25%** lower consumption vs. LEAP‑1A.

**Challenges**: thermal management (−253 °C to hot‑fuel circuits), certification baselines for hybrid‑cryogenic systems, acoustic/structural complexity of Open Fan, dual infrastructure at airports.

**Outlook**: viable for **100–200‑seat** aircraft with **transcontinental** range by **2040–2045** (subject to program risk and infra build‑out).

**References**: see numbered links in the original README for background sources.
