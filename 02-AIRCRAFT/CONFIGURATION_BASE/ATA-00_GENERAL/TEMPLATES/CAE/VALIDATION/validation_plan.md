# CAE Validation Plan

## Objective

Define a systematic approach to validate CAE simulation capabilities against experimental data and analytical solutions to establish confidence in predictions for design and certification.

## Scope

This plan covers validation activities for:
- CFD simulations (flow, heat transfer, multiphase)
- FEA simulations (stress, thermal, dynamics)
- Multi-physics coupling
- Material models

## Validation Strategy

### 1. Phenomena Identification

Identify all relevant physics phenomena for the application:

| ID | Phenomenon | Importance | Status |
|----|------------|------------|--------|
| P01 | Turbulent flow | High | In progress |
| P02 | Heat transfer | High | Planned |
| P03 | Phase change | Medium | Not started |
| P04 | Structural response | High | In progress |
| P05 | Contact mechanics | Medium | Planned |

### 2. Test Matrix

Define validation test cases covering key phenomena:

| Case ID | Description | Level | Data Source | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------------|----------|
| VAL-CFD-001 | Pipe flow | 1 | Analytical | High |
| VAL-CFD-002 | Backward facing step | 2 | NASA TMR | High |
| VAL-CFD-003 | Heat exchanger | 3 | Internal test | Medium |
| VAL-FEA-001 | Cantilever beam | 1 | Analytical | High |
| VAL-FEA-002 | Plate with hole | 2 | Peterson | High |

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

For each validation case:

| Metric | Target | Minimum Acceptable |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| R² | > 0.98 | > 0.95 |
| RMSE | < 5% | < 10% |
| MAPE | < 10% | < 15% |
