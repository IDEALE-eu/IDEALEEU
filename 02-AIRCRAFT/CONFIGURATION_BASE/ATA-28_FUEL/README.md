# ATA-28 FUEL

Fuel system configuration including hydrogen (H2) storage and distribution systems.

## Overview

This chapter contains the complete configuration for the aircraft fuel system, with special emphasis on hydrogen fuel storage, cryogenic systems, and associated safety parameters.

## System Description

The fuel system includes:
- Hydrogen storage tanks (cryogenic)
- Fuel distribution and management
- Pressure and temperature control
- Leak detection systems
- Safety and emergency systems
