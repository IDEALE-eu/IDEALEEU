# ATA-27 FLIGHT CONTROLS

Flight control system configuration.

## Overview

This chapter contains the complete configuration for the aircraft flight control system, including primary and secondary flight control surfaces, actuators, and control laws.

## System Description

The flight control system includes:
- Primary flight controls (ailerons, elevators, rudder)
- Secondary flight controls (flaps, slats, spoilers)
- Flight control computers (FCC)
- Actuators and servos
- Control laws and algorithms
- Redundancy and voting logic

## Key Interfaces

- **ATA-22**: Auto flight (autopilot commands)
- **ATA-25**: Cockpit controls (pilot inputs)
- **ATA-34**: Air data (for flight envelope protection)
- **ATA-42**: IMA platform (if FCC hosted on IMA)
- **ATA-92**: EWIS (all wiring to FCCs and actuators)

## Safety Considerations

Flight controls are **safety-critical** (DAL-A):
- Redundant architectures (typically triple or quadruple)
- Dissimilar redundancy where applicable
- Comprehensive failure detection and isolation
- Fail-safe and fail-operational design
- Extensive verification and validation
