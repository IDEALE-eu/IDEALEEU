# Configuration Management Rules

This document defines the core rules governing the organization and management of aircraft configuration data within the CONFIGURATION_BASE structure.

## Overview

These rules ensure consistency, traceability, and compliance across all ATA chapters and system configurations.

## Core Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth
Each configuration item has exactly one authoritative location in the structure.

### 2. Immutable Baselines
Approved baselines cannot be modified; changes create new baseline versions.

### 3. Complete Traceability
Every configuration item must be traceable to requirements, ICDs, and change records.

## Primary Configuration Rules

### Rule 1: LRU Primary Location

**Statement**: Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) reside in their primary ATA chapter based on functional classification.

**Rationale**: Ensures clear ownership and prevents duplication of hardware configuration data.

**Implementation**:
- LRU hardware configuration goes in the ATA chapter corresponding to its primary function
- Example: Flight Control Computer (FCC) → ATA-27_FLIGHT_CONTROLS
- Example: Air Data Computer (ADC) → ATA-34_NAVIGATION
- Cross-references allowed via ICD/ directories

**Exceptions**:
- IMA modules and chassis → ATA-42_INTEGRATED_MODULAR_AVIONICS
- Network switches and routers → ATA-42 (when part of IMA infrastructure)

### Rule 2: Software Placement with Host LRU

**Statement**: Software resides with its host Line Replaceable Unit.

**Rationale**: Maintains software-hardware coupling and simplifies configuration management.

**Implementation**:
- Software baselines stored in SW_BASELINE/ of the host LRU's ATA chapter
- Software part numbers and versions documented with hardware configuration
- Example: FCC application software → ATA-27_FLIGHT_CONTROLS/SW_BASELINE/
- Example: IMA partition software → ATA-42/SW_BASELINE/ (with partition mapping)

**Special Cases**:
- **IMA Hosted Applications**: Software resides in ATA-42/SW_BASELINE/ with explicit partition bindings
- **Shared Libraries**: Document in host system chapter with references in dependent chapters
- **FADEC Software**: Resides in ATA-76_ENGINE_CONTROLS/SW_BASELINE/

### Rule 3: EWIS Centralization

**Statement**: ALL Electrical Wiring Interconnection System (EWIS) configurations reside ONLY in ATA-92_EWIS.

**Rationale**: Regulatory compliance (FAA/EASA EWIS requirements) and centralized wire management.

**Implementation**:
- Wire specifications, routing, and installation → ATA-92_EWIS
- Harness definitions and assemblies → ATA-92_EWIS/BASELINE/
- Connector and splice configurations → ATA-92_EWIS/HW_CONFIG/
- Zone wire lists → ATA-92_EWIS/PARAMS/
- Shielding and grounding specifications → ATA-92_EWIS/PARAMS/

**Prohibited**:
- ❌ Wire routing in system ATA chapters (e.g., ATA-27)
- ❌ Harness definitions outside ATA-92
- ❌ Connector pinouts in LRU chapters (reference only)

**Allowed**:
- ✓ LRU connector types and part numbers in system chapters (without pinouts)
- ✓ References to ATA-92 for detailed wiring
- ✓ Interface signal definitions in system ICD/ directories

### Rule 4: Change Control Requirement

**Statement**: All configuration changes require formal Engineering Change Request (ECR) and Engineering Change Order (ECO) through the Configuration Control Board (CCB).

**Implementation**:
- Submit ECR to CCB for approval
- Upon approval, ECO issued
- Changes documented in CHANGE_LOG/
- Traceability maintained to ECR/ECO numbers
- Baseline updates at appropriate gates

**Emergency Changes**:
- Follow expedited CCB process
- Document emergency approval
- Retroactive ECR/ECO within 48 hours

### Rule 5: Baseline Immutability

**Statement**: Approved baselines are immutable; modifications create new baseline versions.

**Implementation**:
- Baseline directories frozen at gate approval
- New changes create new baseline version
- Version numbers follow semantic versioning
- SHA-256 hashes verify baseline integrity
- Historical baselines preserved

## Data Organization Rules

### Rule 6: Standard Directory Structure

**Statement**: Each ATA chapter uses the standard 7-directory structure.

**Required Directories**:
1. `PARAMS/` - Parameters and limits
2. `BASELINE/` - Configuration baselines
3. `HW_CONFIG/` - Hardware configuration
4. `SW_BASELINE/` - Software baselines
5. `ICD/` - Interface control documents
6. `VERIFICATION/` - V&V artifacts
7. `CHANGE_LOG/` - Change history

**Optional**: Additional subdirectories allowed with CCB approval.

### Rule 7: File Naming Conventions

**Statement**: Files follow standardized naming conventions for consistency.

**Conventions**:
- `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.extension`
- Parameters: `[PARAMETER_NAME].csv` or `[PARAMETER_NAME].json`
- Baselines: `BASELINE_[VERSION]_[GATE].csv`
- ICDs: `ICD_[SYSTEM1]_TO_[SYSTEM2]_[VERSION].pdf`
- Change logs: `CHANGE_LOG_[YYYY].csv`

**Examples**:
- `H2_STORAGE_PRESSURE.csv`
- `BASELINE_V1.0_PDR.csv`
- `ICD_FCC_TO_FADEC_V2.1.pdf`
- `CHANGE_LOG_2024.csv`

### Rule 8: Version Control

**Statement**: All configuration items are under version control with appropriate branching strategy.

**Implementation**:
- Main branch: Approved baselines only
- Feature branches: Development and ECR work
- Release tags: Gate baselines (SRR, PDR, CDR, etc.)
- Commit messages reference ECR/ECO numbers

---

## Cross-Chapter Rules

### Rule 9: Interface Management

**Statement**: Interfaces between systems documented in both system chapters with primary ownership.

**Implementation**:
- Primary ICD in the "providing" system chapter
- Reference ICD in the "consuming" system chapter
- Cross-references maintained in ICD/ directories
- Interface changes require approval from both system owners

**Example**:
- FCC provides data to FADEC
- Primary ICD: ATA-27_FLIGHT_CONTROLS/ICD/ICD_FCC_TO_FADEC.pdf
- Reference: ATA-76_ENGINE_CONTROLS/ICD/REFS/ICD_FCC_TO_FADEC_REF.md

### Rule 10: Shared Components

**Statement**: Components used across multiple systems documented once with cross-references.

**Implementation**:
- Component in primary functional ATA chapter
- Cross-reference documents in other chapters
- Part number mapping in Item Master
- Configuration controlled through primary chapter
