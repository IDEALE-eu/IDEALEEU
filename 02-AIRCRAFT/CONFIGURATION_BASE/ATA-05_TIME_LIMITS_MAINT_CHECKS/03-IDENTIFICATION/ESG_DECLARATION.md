  - Energy: Ground power for systems checks
  - Estimated impact: 5-10 kg CO₂e per check

- **B-Check** (Intermediate maintenance): Moderate environmental impact
  - Additional fluids, lubricants, minor replacements
  - Energy: Extended ground power, test cell usage
  - Estimated impact: 20-40 kg CO₂e per check

- **C-Check** (Heavy maintenance): Significant environmental impact
  - Structural inspections, major component replacements
  - Chemical usage: NDT fluids, cleaning agents, protective coatings
  - Energy: Multi-day hangar operations
  - Estimated impact: 100-200 kg CO₂e per check

- **D-Check** (Major overhaul): High environmental impact
  - Complete aircraft teardown and reassembly
  - Extensive material and chemical usage
  - Energy: Weeks of hangar operations, test facilities
  - Estimated impact: 500-1000 kg CO₂e per check

### 1.2 Waste Management
- **Hazardous Waste**: Chemicals, fluids, batteries disposed per regulatory requirements
- **Recyclable Materials**: Metal components, packaging materials segregated for recycling
- **Circular Economy**: Component repair and requalification preferred over replacement

### 1.3 Emissions Reduction
- **Ground Support Equipment**: Transitioning to electric GSE where feasible
- **Energy Efficiency**: LED lighting, optimized HVAC in maintenance facilities
- **Green Cleaning**: Low-VOC, biodegradable cleaning products where approved

### 1.4 ISO 14001:2015 Alignment
- Environmental Management System (EMS) integration
- Continuous improvement targets: 10% reduction in waste per check by 2027
- Environmental aspect/impact register maintained
- Regular environmental audits conducted

- **Certifications**: ISO 9001, AS9100, ISO 14001 where applicable

### 3.3 Transparency & Accountability
- **Public Disclosure**: ESG metrics published annually (aggregate, anonymized)
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Regular reviews with operators, regulators, workforce
- **Third-Party Audit**: Independent verification of ESG claims
- **Continuous Improvement**: Metrics tracked, targets set, progress reported

### 3.4 Data Governance
- **Data Privacy**: Maintenance records handled per GDPR and applicable regulations
- **Data Security**: Cybersecurity controls per aerospace standards
