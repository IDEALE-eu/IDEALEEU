    notes: |
      This is the foundational baseline establishing the ATA-05 configuration
      structure per the IDEALE-EU Configuration Management Program (CMP-STD-1001).
      
      The baseline implements the directory structure specified in the program
      README with four main subdirectories:
      - 01-MAINTENANCE_TASKS: Executable S1000D work packages
      - 02-DATA_MODULES: Source data modules (DMCs)
      - 03-IDENTIFICATION: Baseline ID, ESG declaration, CMP references
      - 04-REVISIONS: Change history and ECN records
      
      Compliance references established:
      - S1000D Issue 5.0 for technical publications
      - EASA CS-25 / FAA Part 25.1529 for continued airworthiness
      - IDEALE-EU CMP-STD-1001 for configuration management
      - ISO 14001:2015 for environmental management
      
      ESG impact assessment completed and documented in ESG_DECLARATION.md.
      
      Full CCB approval pending; initial approval by CMP Lead only.
