# Aircraft Pilot Systems Validation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Phase:** Pilot Implementation (Weeks 1-2)  
**Location:** `02-AIRCRAFT/MODEL_IDENTIFICATION/AMPEL360-AIR-T/ARCH/BWB-H2-Hy-E/FAMILY/Q100_STD01/DOMAIN`

---

## Executive Summary

Three validation scripts were executed to verify the structural integrity and compliance of aircraft systems following TFA (Threading Functional Architecture) rules:

1. **validate-aircraft-systems.sh** - Domain and system-level validation
2. **validate-aircraft-subsystems.sh** - Subsystem structure validation  
3. **validate-aircraft-components.sh** - Component-level CAx structure validation

### Overall Results

| Validation Level | Status | Errors | Warnings | Exit Code |
|-----------------|--------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Systems | ❌ FAILED | 11 | 66 | 1 |
| Subsystems | ❌ FAILED | 206 | 483 | 1 |
| Components | ✅ PASSED | 0 | 18 | 0 |

## 1. Systems Validation Results

**Script:** `scripts/validate-aircraft-systems.sh`  
**Exit Code:** 1 (Failed)  
**Errors:** 11  
**Warnings:** 66

### Summary Statistics

- **Total domains found:** 15/15 ✓
- **Total systems found:** 109
- **Systems with INTEGRATION_VIEW.md:** 88/109 (81%)
- **Systems with INTERFACE_MATRIX/:** 79/109 (72%)
- **Systems with SUBSYSTEMS/:** 98/109 (90%)

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **INTERFACE_MATRIX directories incorrectly placed at SYSTEMS level** (11 errors)
   - Several domains have INTERFACE_MATRIX as a directory within SYSTEMS/ rather than within individual systems
   - Affected domains: PPP, MEC, LCC, EDI, EEE, EER, DDD, CCC, IIS, LIB, AAP, CQH, OOO
   - Impact: These directories are being incorrectly validated as systems

2. **Missing INTEGRATION_VIEW.md files** (21 warnings)
   - Primarily in CQH-CRYOGENICS-QUANTUM-H2 domain systems
   - Template/reserved systems in OOO-OS-ONTOLOGIES-OFFICE

3. **Missing INTERFACE_MATRIX/ directories** (24 warnings)
   - Same systems as missing INTEGRATION_VIEW.md

4. **Missing CSV files in INTERFACE_MATRIX/** (21 warnings)
   - Most template and reserved systems in OOO-OS-ONTOLOGIES-OFFICE
   - Expected for template systems

### Recommendation

The INTERFACE_MATRIX directories at the SYSTEMS level should be moved to domain level or removed to prevent validation confusion. This is a structural issue rather than missing functionality.

---

## 2. Subsystems Validation Results

**Script:** `scripts/validate-aircraft-subsystems.sh`  
**Exit Code:** 1 (Failed)  
**Errors:** 206  
**Warnings:** 483

### Summary Statistics

- **Total subsystems:** 467
- **Subsystems with README.md:** 467/467 (100%) ✓
- **Subsystems with META.json:** 287/467 (61%)
- **Subsystems with inherit.json:** 287/467 (61%)
- **Subsystems with PLM/:** 450/467 (96%)
- **Subsystems with PLM/CAx/:** 210/467 (45%)
- **Subsystems with PLM/EBOM_LINKS.md:** 440/467 (94%)

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Missing META.json files** (180 errors)
   - Required for subsystem identification and scope definition
   - All subsystems must have META.json with `scope: "instance"`

2. **Missing PLM/CAx/ directories** (257 warnings)
   - Only 45% of subsystems have complete CAx structure
   - This is expected for pilot phase - full implementation is progressive

3. **Missing inherit.json files** (180 warnings)
   - Inheritance configuration needed for domain-level policy propagation

4. **Missing PLM directories** (17 errors)
   - Critical structural issue for affected subsystems

### Subsystem Completion by Domain

| Domain | Total Subsystems | With Complete CAx | Completion % |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| AAA-AIRFRAMES-AERODYNAMICS-AIRWORTHINESS | 46 | 27 | 59% |
| OOO-OS-ONTOLOGIES-OFFICE | 38 | 24 | 63% |
| CQH-CRYOGENICS-QUANTUM-H2 | 36 | 25 | 69% |
| DDD-DRAINAGE-DEHUMIDIFICATION-DRYING | 29 | 29 | 100% ✓ |
| EEE-ELECTRICAL-ENDOTRANSPONDERS-CIRCULATION | 22 | 22 | 100% ✓ |
| LCC-LINKAGES-CONTROL-COMMUNICATIONS | 42 | 27 | 64% |
| MEC-MECHANICAL-SYSTEMS-MODULES | 36 | 34 | 94% |

### Recommendation

Priority should be given to creating META.json and inherit.json files for all 467 subsystems. These are critical metadata files that are quick to generate using templates.

---

## 3. Components Validation Results

**Script:** `scripts/validate-aircraft-components.sh`  
**Exit Code:** 0 (Passed)  
**Errors:** 0 ✓

- **Complete CAx structures (all 9 subdirs):** 192/210 (91%) ✓
- **CAx directories with README.md:** 192/210 (91%)
- **CAx Structure Completion:** 91.4%

    paths:
      - "*.txt"
  allow_failure: false
```

### Integration Points

- **Pull request checks** - Mandatory validation on PRs
- **Nightly builds** - Full validation suite
- **Release gates** - Block releases with validation failures

---

## Recommendations for Next Phase

### Immediate Actions (Week 3)

1. **Generate missing META.json files** for all 180 subsystems
2. **Generate missing inherit.json files** for inheritance chains
3. **Relocate INTERFACE_MATRIX directories** from SYSTEMS level
4. **Create missing PLM directories** for 17 subsystems

### Short-term Actions (Weeks 4-6)

1. **Add INTEGRATION_VIEW.md** to systems missing documentation
2. **Complete CAx structures** for 18 subsystems with incomplete dirs
3. **Add CSV files** to INTERFACE_MATRIX directories where appropriate
4. **Implement automated validation** in CI/CD pipeline

### Long-term Actions (Phase 2)

1. **Expand pilot systems** from 48 to all 109 systems
2. **Complete CAx implementation** for remaining 257 subsystems
3. **Enhance validation scripts** with additional checks
4. **Integrate with Digital Thread** validation framework

---

## Conclusion

The pilot implementation validation has identified structural completeness at the component level (91% CAx completion) while revealing metadata gaps at the subsystem level (61% META.json completion). The validation scripts are production-ready and suitable for CI/CD integration.

**Overall Pilot Assessment:** 🟡 ACCEPTABLE WITH REMEDIATION

The pilot systems demonstrate solid architectural foundation with clear remediation paths for identified issues. Component-level excellence (0 errors) validates the CAx structure, while metadata gaps are addressable through template-based generation.

## Executive Summary

Three validation scripts have been created and executed against the AMPEL360-AIR-T aircraft model structure:

1. **validate-aircraft-systems.sh** - Systems-level validation
2. **validate-aircraft-subsystems.sh** - Subsystems-level validation
3. **validate-aircraft-components.sh** - Components-level validation (TFA)

RECOMMENDATION
[0;31m✗ ERROR:[0m No component structure found in aircraft systems

The aircraft systems lack component configuration structure.
Expected structure: DOMAIN/{ATA_CHAPTER}/SYSTEMS/{ATA_MID}/CONF/BASELINE/COMPONENTS/{COMP}/SUBPRODUCT/{SUBPROD_ID}

To create component structure, use:
  cd 02-AIRCRAFT/MODEL_IDENTIFICATION
  make add-item DOMAIN=<domain> ATA_CHAPTER=<chapter> ATA_MID=<system> COMP=<component> ...

See CORRECTIVE_ACTION_PLAN.md for detailed guidance.

```

**Key Findings**:
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No component configuration structure exists
- ❌ 0 systems have CONF/BASELINE/COMPONENTS directories
- ❌ 0 components defined
- ❌ TFA (Technical Functional Architecture) not implemented

**Impact**:
- Cannot manage component lifecycle

## Corrective Actions Required

### Priority 1 - Critical (Components)
**Action**: Implement TFA component structure across all systems  
**Timeline**: 12 weeks (phased rollout)  
**Impact**: Enables component lifecycle and configuration management

See detailed plan: [02-AIRCRAFT/CORRECTIVE_ACTION_PLAN.md](../02-AIRCRAFT/CORRECTIVE_ACTION_PLAN.md)

### Priority 2 - High (Subsystems)
**Action**: Complete PLM/CAx structure for remaining 55% of subsystems  
**Timeline**: 8 weeks  
**Impact**: Improves CAx tool integration and engineering workflows

**Action**: Add missing documentation (README.md, interface CSVs)  
**Timeline**: 2 weeks  
**Impact**: Improves system understanding and maintainability

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate** (Week 1-2):
   - Review and approve corrective action plan
   - Assign resources and teams

2. **Short-term** (Week 3-6):
   - Roll out TFA to priority domains (AAA, MEC, EEE)
   - Create automation scripts for bulk CAx directory creation
   - Begin TRACE structure implementation

3. **Medium-term** (Week 7-12):
   - Complete TFA rollout to all domains
   - Achieve 95%+ CAx coverage
   - Complete all documentation gaps
   - Integrate validation into CI/CD pipeline
