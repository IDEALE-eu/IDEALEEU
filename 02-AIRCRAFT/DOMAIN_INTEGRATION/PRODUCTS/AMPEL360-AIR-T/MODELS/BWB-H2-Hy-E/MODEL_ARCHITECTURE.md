# BWB-H2-Hy-E — Model Architecture
**Concept:** Blended Wing Body with Hydrogen Hybrid-Electric propulsion.

## Energy Topology
H₂ (ATA-28) → Conditioning/HX (21/28) → Fuel Cell / Turbomachinery (71/72)  
→ DC Bus (24) → Inverters/Drives (24-30) → Propulsors / Fans (71/72)  
Control & Supervision: IMA (ATA-42), FADEC (ATA-73)

## Design Tenets
- SW colocated with host LRU (42/73); EWIS only in 92.
- Thermal loops sized for cold-soak & hot-day; boil-off managed.
- Load-shed priorities on 24 per mission phase.

## Model Artefacts
- Integration views live under each ATA system (see /VERSION/Q100/SYSTEMS/*).
- Interface matrices declare cross-chapter links (28↔24/21/42/92…).
