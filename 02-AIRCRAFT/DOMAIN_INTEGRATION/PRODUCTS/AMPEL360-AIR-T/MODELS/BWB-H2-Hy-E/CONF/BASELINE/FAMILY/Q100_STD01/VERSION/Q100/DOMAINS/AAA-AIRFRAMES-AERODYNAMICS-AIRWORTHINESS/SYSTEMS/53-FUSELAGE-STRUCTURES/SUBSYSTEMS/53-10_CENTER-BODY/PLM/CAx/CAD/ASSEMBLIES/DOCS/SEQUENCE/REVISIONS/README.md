# REVISIONS — Document Revision Control

## Purpose

This directory contains revision-controlled assembly sequence documentation organized by status (draft, released, obsolete).

## Contents

### Subdirectories
- **[DRAFT/](DRAFT/)** — Draft documents under development
- **[RELEASED/](RELEASED/)** — Released and approved documents
- **[OBSOLETE/](OBSOLETE/)** — Superseded or obsolete documents

### Revision Management
- Version control
- Change tracking
- Approval records
- Effectivity management

## Revision Workflow

### Document Lifecycle
```
DRAFT → Review → Approval → RELEASED → Superseded → OBSOLETE
```

### Status Definitions
- **Draft**: Under development, not for production use
- **Released**: Approved for production use
- **Obsolete**: Superseded by newer version, archived for reference

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern with revision indicator:
```
53-10_<document-type>_<description>_<version>.<ext>
```

Version format: `v01`, `v02`, `v03`, etc.

Examples:
- `53-10_SEQ_FRAME-INSTALL_v01.pdf` (Draft)
- `53-10_SEQ_FRAME-INSTALL_v02.pdf` (Released)
- `53-10_SEQ_FRAME-INSTALL_v01.pdf` (Obsolete after v02 release)

## Revision Control

### Version Management
- Sequential version numbering
