# CLAMPS — Work Holding and Clamping Systems

## Purpose

This directory contains clamping mechanisms and hold-down devices for securing parts during assembly and manufacturing operations.

## Contents

### Subdirectories

- **[MANUAL/](./MANUAL/)** — Hand-operated clamps and toggle clamps
- **[PNEUMATIC/](./PNEUMATIC/)** — Air-powered clamping systems
- **[HYDRAULIC/](./HYDRAULIC/)** — Hydraulic clamping systems

## Clamp Types

### Manual Clamps
- Toggle clamps
- Cam-action clamps
- C-clamps
- Strap clamps
- Wedge clamps

### Pneumatic Clamps
- Single-acting air cylinders
- Double-acting air cylinders
- Swing clamps
- Power clamps with pressure regulation

### Hydraulic Clamps
- High-force hydraulic cylinders
- Hydraulic swing clamps
- Multi-port manifold systems
- Pressure-regulated clamping

## Design Requirements

All clamping systems should:
- Provide adequate clamping force without part distortion
- Allow repeatable clamping positions
- Include pressure/force monitoring (for powered systems)
- Be easily accessible for operation
- Include safety features (pressure relief, guards)
- Document clamping force requirements

## Safety Considerations

- Maximum safe working pressure
- Force application points
- Pinch point protection
- Emergency release procedures
- Personal protective equipment requirements
