# ACCESS_PANELS â€” Removable Access Panel Parts

## Purpose

This directory contains CAD part files for removable access panels used in the 53-10 Center Body subsystem. Access panels provide inspection and maintenance access to internal systems and structure while maintaining aerodynamic smoothness and structural integrity.

## Component Description

### Panel Types
- **Inspection panels**: Small panels for visual inspection
- **Service panels**: Larger panels for equipment access
- **Quick-access panels**: Tool-free or quick-release panels
- **Structural panels**: Load-carrying removable panels
- **Non-structural panels**: Cover panels with no load-bearing function

### Components
- **Panel skin**: Outer surface matching OML or IML contour
- **Stiffening**: Internal reinforcement if required
- **Fastener provisions**: Holes for screws or quick-release fasteners
- **Sealing surface**: Interface for gasket or seal

## Naming Convention

Examples:
- `53-10_ACCESS-PANEL_FWD-KEEL_12x18_v01.CATPart`
- `53-10_ACCESS-PANEL_CENTER-SIDE_24x36_v02.prt`
- `53-10_ACCESS-PANEL_AFT-CROWN_18x24_v01.sldprt`

## Design Considerations

### Structural Requirements
- Match OML or IML contour for aerodynamic smoothness
- Support local air loads if on exterior surface
- Provide stiffness to prevent panel flutter or drumming
- Design for repeated installation and removal

### Material Specifications
- **Aluminum sheet**: 2024-T3 for most panels
- **Composite**: Carbon fiber for weight-critical or large panels
- **Honeycomb**: Sandwich construction for structural panels

### Design Features
- Fastener spacing per structural requirements
- Edge treatment for seal retention
- Lifting or handling provisions for large panels
- Part number and location marking
