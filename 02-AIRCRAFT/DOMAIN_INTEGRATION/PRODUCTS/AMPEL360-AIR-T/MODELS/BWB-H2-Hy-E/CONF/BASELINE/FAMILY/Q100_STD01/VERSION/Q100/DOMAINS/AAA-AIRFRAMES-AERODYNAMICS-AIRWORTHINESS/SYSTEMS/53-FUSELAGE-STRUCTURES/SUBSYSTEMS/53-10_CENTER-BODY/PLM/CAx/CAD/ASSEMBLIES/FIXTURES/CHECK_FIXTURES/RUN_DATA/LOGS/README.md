# LOGS â€” Inspection Operation Logs

## Purpose

This directory contains logs documenting inspection operations, equipment usage, and operational issues.

## Contents

### Log Types
- **Daily inspection logs**: Summary of daily inspection activities
- **Equipment usage logs**: CMM and laser tracker usage tracking
- **Issue logs**: Problems and resolutions
- **Operator logs**: Inspector activity and time tracking
- **Maintenance logs**: Fixture maintenance activities

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern:
```
LOG_<log-type>_<date>.xlsx
```

Examples:
- `LOG_DAILY-INSPECTION_2024-01-15.xlsx`
- `LOG_CMM-USAGE_2024-01.xlsx`
- `LOG_ISSUES_2024-Q1.xlsx`
