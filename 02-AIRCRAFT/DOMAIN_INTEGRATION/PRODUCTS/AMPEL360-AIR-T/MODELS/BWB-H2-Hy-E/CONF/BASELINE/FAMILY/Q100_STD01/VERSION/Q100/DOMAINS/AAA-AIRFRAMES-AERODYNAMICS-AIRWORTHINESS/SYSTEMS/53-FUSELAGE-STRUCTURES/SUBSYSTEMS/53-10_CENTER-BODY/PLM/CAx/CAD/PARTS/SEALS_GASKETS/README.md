# SEALS_GASKETS — Sealing Element Parts

## Purpose

This directory contains CAD part files for seals, gaskets, and sealing elements used in the 53-10 Center Body subsystem. These components provide environmental sealing, pressure sealing, and interface sealing between mating parts.

## Component Description

### Seal Types
- **Pressure seals**: Cabin pressure boundary seals
- **Environmental seals**: Weather sealing for external interfaces
- **Interface seals**: Sealing between mating structural components
- **Access panel seals**: Removable panel edge seals
- **Door seals**: Door perimeter sealing elements
- **Window seals**: Window installation and retention seals

### Material Types
- **Elastomeric**: Rubber, silicone, or synthetic rubber compounds
- **Foam**: Closed-cell foam (neoprene, EPDM)
- **Solid**: Solid gasket materials (cork, fiber, metal)
- **Inflatable**: Pressure-actuated inflatable seals

## Naming Convention

```
53-10_SEAL_<application>_<location>_<version>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_SEAL_ACCESS-PANEL_FWD_v01.CATPart`
- `53-10_GASKET_BULKHEAD_BH-05_v02.prt`
- `53-10_SEAL_DOOR-PERIMETER_MAIN_v01.sldprt`

## Design Considerations

### Sealing Requirements
- Define compression requirements for proper sealing
- Specify material compatibility with fluids and environment
- Account for temperature range (-55°C to +85°C typical)
- Consider aging and compression set properties

### Material Specifications
- **Silicone rubber**: Temperature range, chemical resistance
- **EPDM**: Weather resistance, ozone resistance
- **Neoprene**: Fuel and oil resistance
- **Fluorocarbon (Viton)**: Chemical and temperature resistance

### Installation Features
- Adhesive backing or mechanical retention
- Compression indicators or witness marks
- Alignment features for proper positioning

## File Organization

Organize by:
- Application type (pressure, environmental, interface)
- Location (door, window, panel, bulkhead)
- Standard vs. custom designs

## Cross-References

- **Access panels**: [`../ACCESS_PANELS/`](../ACCESS_PANELS/)
- **Door surrounds**: [`../DOOR_SURROUNDS/`](../DOOR_SURROUNDS/)
- **Window bays**: [`../WINDOW_BAYS/`](../WINDOW_BAYS/)
- **Bulkheads**: [`../BULKHEADS/`](../BULKHEADS/)
- **Material specifications**: [`../../../CAE/DATA/MATERIALS_DB/`](../../../CAE/DATA/MATERIALS_DB/)
- **Detail drawings**: [`../../DRAWINGS/`](../../DRAWINGS/)

## Quality Requirements

Seals and gaskets must meet:
- Material specifications per AS5857 or equivalent
- Flammability requirements per FAR 25.853
- Fluid compatibility per application requirements
- Temperature resistance per environmental conditions
