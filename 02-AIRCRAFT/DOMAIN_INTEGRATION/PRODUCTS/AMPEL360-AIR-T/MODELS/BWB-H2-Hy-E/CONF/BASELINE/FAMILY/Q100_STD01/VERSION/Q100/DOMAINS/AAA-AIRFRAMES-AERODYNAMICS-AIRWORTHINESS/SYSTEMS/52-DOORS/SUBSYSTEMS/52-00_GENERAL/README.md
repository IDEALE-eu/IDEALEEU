# 52-00 GENERAL — Doors

**Purpose**: Common rules for all ATA-52 subsystems: loads & margins, kinematics, seal strategy, tolerance stack-up, safety interlocks, and verification.

**Scope**
- Door kinematics classes, hinge/lock families, torque/effort limits
- Pressurization seal types, leak rates, icing/contamination allowances
- Emergency egress requirements and inhibit logic (interfaces to 25/26/31)
- Structural interfaces to 53/57; bonding/grounding with 24; harness keep-outs (92)

**Deliverables**
- `KINEMATICS_RULES.md` · `SEALING_POLICY.md` · `TOLERANCE_STACKS.xlsx`
- `SAFETY_INTERLOCKS.md` · `VERIF_MATRIX.csv` (trace to tests/evidence)

**CM/Links**
- Changes via ECR/ECO; baselines per `00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/04-BASELINES/`
- ICDs in `00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/09-INTERFACES/`
