# AFT — Aft Zone

## Purpose
DXF files for aft zone components and assemblies.

## Contents
- Aft section frames and ribs
- Aft skin panels
- Aft bulkheads
- Aft fittings and brackets
- Interface drawings with center zone and tail section

## Zone Boundaries
**Aft zone extends**:
- From center zone interface
- To tail/empennage interface
- Includes aft structural elements

## Structural Components
Typical parts in aft zone:
- Aft frames (primary structure)
- Skin panels and doublers
- Aft pressure bulkhead (if pressurized)
- Empennage/tail attach structure
- Engine mount structure (if aft-mounted)
- APU compartment structure (if applicable)
- Aft systems support brackets

## File Naming
```
53-10_AFT_<component>_<type>_<revision>_<date>.dxf
```

Examples:
- `53-10_AFT_FRAME-F15_PROFILE_A_20250110.dxf`
- `53-10_AFT_SKIN-SP25_FLAT_A_20250110.dxf`
- `53-10_AFT_BULKHEAD-BH10_ASSEMBLY_B_20250110.dxf`

## Interface Requirements
Document interfaces with:
- **Center zone**: Structural attachments and load paths
- **Tail/empennage**: Tail attach points and load transfer
- **Engine mounts**: If aft-mounted engines
- **APU**: Auxiliary Power Unit interfaces
- **Systems**: Aft systems installations

## Special Considerations
Aft zone often includes:
- Aft pressure bulkhead (critical for pressurized aircraft)
- Tail load introduction structure
- Engine mount structure (if rear engines)
- APU mounting and access
- Auxiliary systems concentration
- Access for maintenance

## Manufacturing Considerations
- Aft assembly access constraints
- Pressure bulkhead quality critical
- Tail attachment alignment
- Engine mount precision (if applicable)
- Systems installation sequence
- Inspection access planning
