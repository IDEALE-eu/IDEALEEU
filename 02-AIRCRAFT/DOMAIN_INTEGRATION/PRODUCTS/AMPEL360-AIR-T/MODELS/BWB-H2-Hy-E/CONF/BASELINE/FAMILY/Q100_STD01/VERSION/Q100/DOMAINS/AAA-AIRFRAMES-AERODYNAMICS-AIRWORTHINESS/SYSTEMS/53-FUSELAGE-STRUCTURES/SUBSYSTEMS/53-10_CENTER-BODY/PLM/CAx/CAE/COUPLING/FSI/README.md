# FSI â€” Fluid-Structure Interaction

This directory stores coupled fluid-structure interaction analyses.

## Purpose
- Aeroelastic response to aerodynamic loads
- Pressure loading on flexible structures
- Flutter and divergence analysis
- Panel response to flow-induced vibrations

## Guidelines
- Document coupling methodology
- Include convergence criteria for coupled iterations
- Archive both FEA and CFD inputs
- Link to validation test data
