# QA — Quality Assurance

## Purpose

This directory contains quality assurance documentation, checksheets, inspection records, and signoff documentation for center body installation operations.

## Directory Structure

### CHECKSHEETS/
Quality inspection checksheets and forms for installation verification.

### SIGNOFF/
Final acceptance and signoff documentation.

## Content Types

- **Inspection checksheets** — Formatted inspection forms
- **Quality plans** — Installation quality control plans
- **Inspection records** — Completed inspection documentation
- **Non-conformance reports** — Quality issue documentation
- **Acceptance records** — Final quality signoff documentation

## Quality Assurance Activities

### Pre-Installation QA

- Workmanship inspection
- Torque verification
- Sealant application inspection
- Hold point inspections

### Post-Installation QA
- Final dimensional inspection
- Complete functional testing
- Documentation review
- As-built configuration verification
- Final acceptance inspection

## File Formats

- `.pdf` — Inspection forms and reports
- `.xlsx` / `.csv` — Inspection data and checklists
- `.xml` — Structured quality data
