# CALIBRATION — Calibration Management

## Purpose

This directory contains calibration certificates, gage repeatability and reproducibility (Gage R&R) studies, and calibration management documentation for jigs and fixtures.

## Contents

### Subdirectories

- **[CERTS/](./CERTS/)** — Calibration certificates and records
- **[GAUGE_RR/](./GAUGE_RR/)** — Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility studies

## Calibration Certificates

### Contents
- Calibration date and due date
- Calibrated dimensions and features
- Measurement results
- Standards used (traceability)
- Environmental conditions
- Technician identification
- Calibration facility

### Certificate Requirements
Follow:
- **ISO/IEC 17025**: Testing and calibration laboratories
- **ANSI/NCSL Z540.3**: Calibration requirements
- **AS9100**: Quality management for aerospace

## Gage R&R Studies

### Purpose
Evaluate measurement system variation:
- Repeatability (equipment variation)
- Reproducibility (operator variation)
- Total gage R&R
- Acceptance criteria (typically <10% variation)

### Study Contents
- Study plan and objectives
- Sample selection
- Operators and equipment
- Measurement data
- Statistical analysis
- Conclusions and recommendations

## Calibration Schedule

### Frequency
Typical intervals:
- Critical dimensions: 3-6 months
- Standard dimensions: 6-12 months
- Non-contact gages: 12 months
- After repair or adjustment: Before use
- After damage or misuse: Before use

## Calibration Procedure

### Steps
1. Clean and inspect gage/fixture
2. Stabilize to room temperature
3. Use certified reference standards
4. Measure at multiple points
5. Record results
6. Apply calibration label
7. Update calibration database

## Out-of-Tolerance Handling

If out of tolerance:
- Tag and quarantine
- Assess impact on parts measured
- Initiate corrective action
- Repair or replace
- Re-calibrate before use
