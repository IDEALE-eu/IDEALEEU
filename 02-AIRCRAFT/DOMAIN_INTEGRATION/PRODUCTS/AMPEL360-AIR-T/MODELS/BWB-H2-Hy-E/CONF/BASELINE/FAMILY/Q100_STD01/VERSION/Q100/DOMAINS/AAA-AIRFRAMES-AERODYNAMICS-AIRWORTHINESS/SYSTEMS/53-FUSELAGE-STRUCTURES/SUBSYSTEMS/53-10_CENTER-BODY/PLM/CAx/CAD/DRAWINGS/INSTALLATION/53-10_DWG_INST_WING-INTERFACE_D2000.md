### Tolerances
- Position tolerance: ± 0.5 mm
- Angular tolerance: ± 0.1°
- Gap tolerance: 0.0 to 0.3 mm

## Fastener Schedule

### Primary Attachment Bolts
- **Type**: Titanium tension bolts
- **Size**: M16 x 100 mm
- **Quantity**: 8 per wing (16 total)
- **Torque**: TBD N⋅m
- **Locking**: Torque and safety wire

### Shear Pins
- **Type**: High-strength steel
- **Size**: Ø12 mm x 80 mm
- **Quantity**: 4 per wing (8 total)
- **Installation**: Press fit with retention

## Installation Sequence

### Pre-Installation Checks
1. Verify center body alignment and levelness
2. Inspect all mating surfaces for damage
3. Check all fastener holes for cleanliness
4. Verify interface fittings are installed
5. Confirm all torque tools are calibrated

### Installation Steps
1. Position wing assembly using crane and fixture
2. Align forward attachment points
3. Install forward shear pins
4. Align rear attachment points
5. Install rear shear pins
6. Install tension bolts (finger tight)
7. Verify alignment within tolerance
8. Torque tension bolts to specification (sequence: inside-out)
9. Install safety wire on tension bolts
10. Perform final dimensional verification
11. Install fairings and access panels

### Post-Installation Checks
1. Verify all fasteners torqued and safety wired
2. Perform dimensional inspection
3. Check for proper gap clearances
4. Document installation in log book

## Clearance Requirements

- **Minimum access clearance**: 300 mm around all attachment points
- **Tool clearance**: Verify torque wrench accessibility
- **Maintenance access**: Per maintenance manual requirements

## Tooling Requirements

### Special Tools
- Wing lifting fixture (Tool ID: TBD)
- Wing alignment jig (Tool ID: TBD)
- Calibrated torque wrenches (0-500 N⋅m)
- Pin installation tools
- Safety wire tools

### Ground Support Equipment
- Aircraft jack stands
- Wing support stands
- Overhead crane (min. capacity: 5000 kg)

## Interface Control

This installation interfaces with:
- **Wing Assembly**: ATA 57-00 (see wing installation drawings)
- **Systems Integration**: Hydraulic, fuel, electrical pass-throughs
- **Fairings**: Wing-to-body fairings (see ATA 53-50)

## Quality and Inspection

### Inspection Points
- [ ] Pre-installation verification
- [ ] Alignment check (during installation)
