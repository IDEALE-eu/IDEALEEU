# 09-SURFACE_PROTECTION_DRAINAGE — Integration View

## System Overview

Provides comprehensive surface protection, corrosion prevention, sealing, and drainage management for aircraft exterior and internal compartments, ensuring structural integrity and preventing moisture accumulation.

## Functional Description

The 09-SURFACE_PROTECTION_DRAINAGE system encompasses:

- **Corrosion Protection**: Application of protective coatings and treatments to prevent corrosion
