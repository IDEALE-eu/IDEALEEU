# TANK_SUPPORTS â€” Fuel and Hydrogen Tank Support Structures

## Purpose

CAD models for structural supports that carry fuel tanks and hydrogen storage tanks within the center body.

## Support Types

- Tank cradle structures
- Tank attach fittings
- Tank restraint systems
- Anti-slosh baffles (if structural)
- Tank load distribution structure
- Emergency release mechanisms

## Naming Convention

```
53-10_TANK_SUPPORT_<TANK-TYPE>_<ID>_v<VERSION>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_TANK_SUPPORT_H2-TANK_TS-001_v01.CATPart`
- `53-10_TANK_SUPPORT_FUEL-CRADLE_TS-012_v02.prt`

## Design Requirements

- Support full and empty tank loads
- Withstand inertia loads (crash, maneuver)
- Allow thermal expansion
- Provide attachment to fuselage structure
- Meet safety and crashworthiness requirements
