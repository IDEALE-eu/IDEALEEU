# CAx - Computer-Aided Engineering Tools

## Purpose

This directory organizes all computer-aided engineering artifacts by discipline.

## Directory Structure

- [**CAD/**](./CAD/) - Computer-Aided Design (3D models, assemblies, drawings)
- [**CAE/**](./CAE/) - Computer-Aided Engineering (FEA, thermal, CFD analyses)
- [**CAM/**](./CAM/) - Computer-Aided Manufacturing (machining, tooling)
- [**CAI/**](./CAI/) - Computer-Aided Integration (interface definitions, integration matrices)
- [**CAV/**](./CAV/) - Computer-Aided Verification (test plans, validation reports)
- [**CAP/**](./CAP/) - Computer-Aided Production (manufacturing instructions, work orders)
- [**CAS/**](./CAS/) - Computer-Aided Service (maintenance procedures, troubleshooting)
- [**CAO/**](./CAO/) - Computer-Aided Optimization (design optimization studies)
- [**CMP/**](./CMP/) - Computer-Aided Management & Planning (schedules, resource planning)

## Rules

- No PLM outside SUBSYSTEMS/
- Use neutral formats (STEP / JT / glTF) alongside native where possible.
- Include SBOM / BOM exports in EBOM_LINKS.md
