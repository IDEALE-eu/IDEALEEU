# GROUND — Ground Test Campaigns

## Purpose

Ground test campaigns validate structural integrity, durability, and environmental performance of the 53-10 CENTER-BODY through controlled laboratory and facility testing.

## Test Categories

### STATIC/
Static strength testing to demonstrate compliance with limit and ultimate load requirements (CS-25.305).
- Ultimate load tests (1.5× limit load)
- Limit load tests with deflection measurement
- Combined loading scenarios
- Proof testing

### FATIGUE/
Fatigue and durability testing to demonstrate damage tolerance and service life.
- Full-life fatigue testing (design service goal)
- Accelerated spectrum testing
- Residual strength after fatigue
- Crack growth monitoring

### VIBRATION/
Vibration qualification per DO-160 and structural dynamics characterization.
- Sine vibration testing
- Random vibration testing
- Modal testing and frequency response
- Acoustic testing (as required)

### PRESSURIZATION/
Pressurization testing for cabin pressure differential (8.6 psi).
- Static pressurization to design pressure
- Pressure cycling for fatigue life
- Rapid decompression testing
- Leak rate testing

### IMPACT/
Impact damage resistance and tolerance testing.
- Low-velocity impact (tool drop, bird strike)
- High-velocity impact (debris, hail)
- Post-impact strength verification
- Damage detectability assessment

### CRYO/
Cryogenic temperature testing for H₂ tank integration compatibility.
- Material compatibility at -253°C (LH₂ temperature)
- Thermal cycling with cryogenic loads
- Structural performance at cryogenic temperatures
- Thermal gradient effects

### FIRE/
Fire resistance and burnthrough testing per CS-25 requirements.
- Fire exposure per CS-25.855 and 25.856
- Burnthrough resistance timing
- Smoke and toxicity per CS-25.853
- Heat release rate testing

### LIGHTNING/
Lightning strike testing per CS-25.581 and DO-160.
- Direct strike zones verification
- Swept stroke simulation
- Bonding and grounding verification
- Composite material protection effectiveness

## Test Sequencing

Ground tests are typically performed in this sequence:
1. Static proof test (verify structural integrity before other tests)
2. Modal/vibration characterization (baseline dynamic properties)
3. Environmental tests (temperature, vibration, pressurization)
4. Fatigue testing (long-duration test)
5. Post-fatigue residual strength (destructive test)

## Coordination Requirements

- **Facility Booking** — Test facilities reserved 6+ months in advance
- **Test Article Fabrication** — Lead time for dedicated test articles
- **Instrumentation** — Sensor procurement and installation
- **Personnel** — Test engineer staffing and certification
- **Safety Review** — Hazard analysis and safety approval
