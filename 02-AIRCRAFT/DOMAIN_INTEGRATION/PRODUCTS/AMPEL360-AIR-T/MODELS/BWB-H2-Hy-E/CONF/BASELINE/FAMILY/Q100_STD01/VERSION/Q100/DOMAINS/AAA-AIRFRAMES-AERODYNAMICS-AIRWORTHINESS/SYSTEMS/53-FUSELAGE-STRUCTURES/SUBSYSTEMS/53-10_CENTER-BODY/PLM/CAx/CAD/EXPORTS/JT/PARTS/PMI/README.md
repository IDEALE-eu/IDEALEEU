# PMI — Parts with Product Manufacturing Information

## Purpose

JT files for individual parts with embedded Product Manufacturing Information (PMI). These files include geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), annotations, and manufacturing specifications.

## What to Store

- Parts with embedded PMI annotations
- GD&T feature control frames
- Dimension and tolerance data
- Manufacturing notes and callouts
- Critical dimensions and specifications

## Content Included

- ✅ 3D geometry (tessellated)
- ✅ PMI annotations visible in 3D
- ✅ GD&T datums and tolerances
- ✅ Dimensions and callouts
- ✅ Manufacturing notes
- ✅ Surface finish specifications

## Usage

Use PMI parts when:
- Manufacturing reviews
- Supplier coordination
- Inspection planning
- Quality control
- As-manufactured documentation

## Requirements

- Export from CAD system with PMI capability
- JT version 9.5 or later for PMI support
- Validate PMI visibility in JT2Go
- Include all critical dimensions

## Related Directories

- [`../LOD_HIGH/`](../LOD_HIGH/) — High detail parts (geometry only)
- [`../`](../) — PARTS directory
- [`../../ASSEMBLIES/PMI/`](../../ASSEMBLIES/PMI/) — Assembly PMI files
- [`../../README.md`](../../README.md) — JT format overview

## Best Practices

- Include PMI for all manufacturing-critical parts
- Export high-resolution geometry with PMI
- Validate annotations are readable and complete
- Coordinate with STEP AP242 exports (definitive PMI)
- Document PMI export settings
