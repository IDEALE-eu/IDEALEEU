## Required Documentation

### For Each Simplified Model
Must include:
1. **Approval form**: Signed authorization
2. **Validation report**: Test results
3. **Comparison report**: vs. detailed baseline
4. **Usage guidelines**: How to use properly
5. **Change log**: Version history

### For Each LOD Level
Document:
- Definition of LOD level
- Simplification rules applied

- Known limitations
- Approval requirements

## Documentation Standards

Follow:
- **ATA iSpec 2200**: Technical documentation standards
- **AS9100**: Quality management documentation
- **ISO 9001**: Document control procedures
- **Internal procedures**: Company documentation standards

## Version Control

### Document Management
- Version documents with models
- Maintain revision history
- Archive superseded versions
- Cross-reference to model versions

### Change Control
When model changes:
1. Update all affected documents
2. Increment document version
3. Document changes made
4. Re-obtain approvals if needed
5. Archive old versions

## Approval Process

### Step 1: Create Simplified Model
- Designer creates simplified model
- Applies simplification rules
- Documents changes made

### Step 2: Validation Testing
- Validate geometry quality
- Compare mass properties
- Test performance improvements
- Check intended use cases

### Step 3: Documentation
- Complete approval form
- Prepare validation report
- Generate comparison report
- Write usage guidelines

### Step 4: Review and Approval
- Peer review by senior engineer
- Approval by chief engineer
- Sign-off by stakeholders
- Archive approval records

### Step 5: Release
- Tag model version
- Distribute to users
- Provide documentation
- Train users if needed

## Quality Requirements

All documentation must:
- Be complete and accurate
- Follow template formats
- Include all required signatures
- Reference correct model versions
- Be maintained under configuration control

## Retention Policy

Retain documentation for:
- **Active models**: Life of model + 1 year
- **Archived models**: Life of aircraft + 10 years
- **Compliance**: Per regulatory requirements
