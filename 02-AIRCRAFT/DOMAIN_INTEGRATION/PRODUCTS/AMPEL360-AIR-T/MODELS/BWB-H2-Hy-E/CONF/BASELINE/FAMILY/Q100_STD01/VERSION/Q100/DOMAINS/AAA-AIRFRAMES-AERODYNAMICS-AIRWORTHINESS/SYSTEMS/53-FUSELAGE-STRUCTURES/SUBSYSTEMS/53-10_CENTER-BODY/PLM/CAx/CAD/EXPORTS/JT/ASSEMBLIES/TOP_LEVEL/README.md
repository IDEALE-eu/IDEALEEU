# TOP_LEVEL — Complete Center Body Assembly

## Purpose

Top-level assembly JT files representing the complete center body structure. These are the highest-level assemblies containing all sub-assemblies and components.

## What to Store

- Complete center body assembly
- Full product structure
- All frames, stringers, skins, and fittings
- Top-level assembly metadata

## Assembly Contents

The complete center body assembly typically includes:
- Frames (F01-F20)
- Stringers (left/right, upper/lower)
- Skin panels (outer/inner)
- Floors and bulkheads
- Interface fittings
- Standard parts and fasteners

## Usage

Use top-level assemblies for:
- Overall design reviews
- System integration verification
- Stakeholder presentations
- Configuration management
- Aircraft-level integration

## File Characteristics

- **Complexity**: Complete assembly with all components
- **File size**: Large (10-200 MB depending on LOD)
- **Component count**: High (100s to 1000s of parts)
- **Hierarchy depth**: Full structure

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate LOD for viewing context
- Include all major sub-assemblies
- Maintain consistent assembly hierarchy
- Document configuration and effectivity
- Version control with assembly structure
