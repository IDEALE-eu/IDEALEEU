# DOOR_SURROUNDS â€” Door Frame Structures and Reinforcements

## Purpose

CAD models for sub-assemblies that form the structural framework around doors, providing load paths and reinforcement.

## Components

- Door frame assemblies
- Reinforcement rings
- Hinge support structures
- Latch support structures
- Door sill beams
- Door header beams
- Pressure seal support structure

## Naming Convention

```
53-10_DOOR_SURR_<DOOR-TYPE>_<ID>_v<VERSION>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_DOOR_SURR_MAIN-ENTRY_DS-001_v01.CATProduct`
- `53-10_DOOR_SURR_CARGO_DS-012_v02.asm`

## Design Requirements

- Carry door loads and reactions
- Maintain door opening geometry
- Support pressure seals
- Provide hinge and latch attachment
- Integrate with adjacent structure
