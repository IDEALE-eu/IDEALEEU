# 10-PARKING-MOORING — Integration View

## System Overview

Provides secure aircraft parking, environmental mooring, and ground service interfaces for the BWB-H2-Hy-E platform during turnaround, maintenance, or high-wind conditions.

## Functional Description

The 10-PARKING-MOORING system encompasses ground handling functions related to:

- **Aircraft Parking Position Alignment**: Automated visual/inertial docking guidance to parking spot
- **Mooring Systems**: Electromechanical or passive mooring anchors at wingtip/fuselage for wind/weather protection
- **Ground Umbilicals**: H₂/electric/coolant/data umbilicals with breakaway couplings during parking
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Real-time wind monitoring with auto-tensioning or alerting
- **Safety Interlocks**: Mooring status fed to avionics for propulsion inhibit (safe-to-move / safe-to-power logic)
- **GSE Interface**: Interface with autonomous ground support equipment (GSE)
