# OBSOLETE ‚Äî Obsolete DXF Files

## Purpose
Archive of superseded and obsolete DXF files no longer authorized for new production.

## Contents
- Superseded revisions
- Retired part files
- Historical configuration records
- Archived change history
- Reference files for legacy parts

## File Status
Files in OBSOLETE are:
- ‚ùå **Not authorized** for new production
- üìö **Archived** for reference only
- üîí **Configuration controlled** (historical record)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Superseded** by newer revision
- üìã **Maintained** for traceability

## File Naming
Retain original naming:
```
<part>_<description>_<REV>_<date>.dxf
```

Examples:
- `53-10-FRM05_FRAME_A_20250110.dxf` (superseded by Rev B)
- `53-10-SKIN10_FLAT_A_20250105.dxf` (superseded by Rev B)
- `53-10-BRK03_BRACKET_A_20250108.dxf` (part retired)

## Reasons for Obsolescence
Files moved to OBSOLETE when:
- Superseded by new revision
- Part design changed significantly
- Part number retired or cancelled
- Product line discontinued
- Configuration baseline changed

## Archive Information
Document for each obsolete file:
- Date of obsolescence
- Reason for obsolescence
- Superseding revision (if applicable)
- Last use in production
- Affected serial numbers or lots
- Reference to change order (ECO/PCO)

## Usage Guidelines
**DO**:
- Retain for historical record
- Use for reference only
- Support legacy part production (if authorized)
- Maintain for configuration traceability
- Keep for warranty and service support

**DO NOT**:
- Use for new production without authorization
- Delete or remove from archive
- Modify obsolete files
- Reference in new designs

## Configuration Traceability
Maintain links to:
- Production records using obsolete files
- Serial numbers or batches affected
- Service history and maintenance records
- Warranty claims and field issues
- Engineering change orders (ECOs)

## Retention Requirements
- Retain per regulatory requirements
- Minimum 10-15 years typical for aerospace
- Longer for safety-critical parts
- Permanent for certified aircraft
- Link to product lifecycle

## Related Directories
- **[../RELEASED/](../RELEASED/)** ‚Äî Current released files
- **[../DRAFT/](../DRAFT/)** ‚Äî New development
- **[../../PARTS/](../../PARTS/)** ‚Äî Active part files

## Archive Management
- Regularly review and organize
- Maintain clear obsolescence records
- Document supersession relationships
- Keep audit trail of changes
- Ensure proper backup and storage

## Best Practices
- Never delete obsolete files
- Document reason for obsolescence
- Link to superseding revision
- Maintain configuration history
- Support field service needs
- Regular archive verification

## Access and Retrieval
Obsolete files may be needed for:
- Legacy product support
- Spare parts manufacturing
- Field service and repair
- Failure investigation
- Configuration audits
- Regulatory compliance
