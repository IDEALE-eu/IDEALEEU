# CHECKPOINTS — Quality Checkpoints

## Purpose

This directory contains quality checkpoint definitions that specify when and what to inspect during the 53-10 Center Body assembly process.

## Contents

### Checkpoint Documentation
- Checkpoint definitions
- Inspection criteria
- Measurement methods
- Acceptance standards
- Verification procedures

## Checkpoint Types

### Pre-Assembly Checkpoints
- Parts received inspection
- Parts condition verification
- Tooling calibration check
- Material certification review
- Cleanliness verification

### In-Process Checkpoints
- Alignment verification
- Dimensional checks
- Fastener installation verification
- Torque verification
- Visual inspection

### Post-Assembly Checkpoints
- Final dimension verification
- Functional testing
- Surface finish inspection
- Cleanliness check
- Documentation verification

### Hold Points
- Critical checkpoints requiring approval before proceeding
- Witness points for customer/authority inspection
- FAI (First Article Inspection) requirements

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern:
```
53-10_CHECKPOINT_<checkpoint-id>_<operation-id>_<version>.<ext>
```

- `53-10_CHECKPOINT_CP001_FRAME-PRE-ASSY_v01.pdf`
- `53-10_CHECKPOINT_CP002_FASTENER-INSTALL_v02.pdf`
- `53-10_CHECKPOINT_CP003_FINAL-INSPECT_v01.pdf`

## Checkpoint Documentation Structure

### Standard Elements

#### Checkpoint Identification
- Checkpoint number
- Operation reference
- When to perform
- Inspector qualification

#### Inspection Requirements
- What to inspect
- Inspection method
- Measuring equipment
- Sample size
- Frequency

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Specification limits
- Tolerances
- Visual standards
- Reference standards
- Workmanship criteria

#### Documentation
- Recording method
- Required signatures
- Traceability requirements
- Non-conformance procedure

## Checkpoint Implementation

### Process Flow
1. Reach checkpoint in assembly sequence
2. Notify inspector
3. Perform inspection per checkpoint definition
4. Record results on checksheet
5. Obtain required approvals
6. Proceed if acceptable, or initiate non-conformance

### Hold Point Process
- Assembly stops at hold point
- Inspector/authority notified
- Inspection performed
- Approval documented
- Assembly continues only after approval
