# CAS â€” Computer-Aided Simulation

## Purpose
System-level simulation models and multi-physics analyses.

## Contents
- Multi-physics simulation models
- System-level structural behavior models
- Coupled analyses (thermal-structural, fluid-structure)
- Dynamic response simulations

## Formats
- Simulation software files (various solvers)
- Simulation reports (PDF)
- Animation files

## Guidelines
- Document simulation assumptions and boundary conditions
- Include convergence studies
- Validate against test data where available
