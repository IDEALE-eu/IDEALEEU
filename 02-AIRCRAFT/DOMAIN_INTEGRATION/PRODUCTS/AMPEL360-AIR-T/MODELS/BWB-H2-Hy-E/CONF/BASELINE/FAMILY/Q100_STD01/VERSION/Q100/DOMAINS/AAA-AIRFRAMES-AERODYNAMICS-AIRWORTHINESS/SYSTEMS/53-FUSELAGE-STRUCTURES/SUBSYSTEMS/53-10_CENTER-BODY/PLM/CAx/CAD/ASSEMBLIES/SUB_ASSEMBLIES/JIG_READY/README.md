# JIG_READY â€” Jig-Ready Assembly Configurations

## Purpose

This directory contains jig-ready assembly configurations for the 53-10 Center Body sub-assemblies. Jig-ready models represent assemblies prepared for installation in assembly jigs or manufacturing fixtures, including temporary fasteners, assembly aids, and positioning features.

## Contents

### Jig-Ready Configurations
- **With drill jigs**: Assemblies showing drill jig installations
- **With assembly fixtures**: Temporary fixtures for alignment
- **With temporary fasteners**: Cleco or temporary bolts
- **With alignment pins**: Positioning and alignment hardware
- **With support stands**: Temporary support during assembly

### Assembly Sequence Models
- **Step-by-step assembly**: Sequential assembly states
- **Work-in-progress**: Partially assembled configurations
- **Installation states**: Assembly at various completion stages
- **Fit-check configurations**: Test-fit assemblies

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern for jig-ready models:
```
53-10_ASM_JIG-READY_<assembly>_<stage>_v<version>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_ASM_JIG-READY_FRAME-F05_SKIN-INSTALL_v01.CATProduct`
- `53-10_ASM_JIG-READY_STRINGER-L01_SPLICE_v02.asm`
- `53-10_ASM_JIG-READY_PANEL-P01_DRILL_v01.sldasm`

## Jig-Ready Features

### Temporary Fasteners
- **Cleco fasteners**: Spring-loaded temporary fasteners for alignment
- **Temporary bolts**: Alignment bolts removed after permanent installation
- **Alignment pins**: Precision pins for positioning
- **Clamps**: C-clamps or spring clamps for holding parts

### Assembly Aids
- **Drill bushings**: Guide holes for accurate drilling
- **Templates**: Drilling or marking templates
- **Alignment blocks**: Positioning gauges and fixtures
- **Shims**: Temporary shims for gap control
- **Spreader bars**: Maintain opening dimensions during assembly

### Fixture Interface
- **Locating points**: Datum holes or surfaces for fixture mounting
- **Support points**: Temporary support locations
- **Access clearances**: Openings for tooling and worker access
- **Lifting provisions**: Temporary lifting eyes or slings

## Assembly Sequence Planning

### Typical Assembly Sequence
1. **Fixture setup**: Install fixture and verify alignment
2. **Primary component**: Install major structural component
3. **Temporary fastening**: Install Clecos or temporary fasteners
4. **Secondary components**: Add additional parts to assembly
5. **Alignment check**: Verify dimensions and alignment
6. **Final fastening**: Install permanent fasteners
7. **Fixture removal**: Remove assembly from fixture
8. **Final inspection**: Verify completed assembly

## Integration with Manufacturing

Jig-ready models support:
- **Manufacturing planning**: Assembly sequence development
- **Fixture design**: Fixture requirements and locations
- **Tooling design**: Custom tooling and templates
- **Worker training**: Assembly procedure documentation
- **Quality planning**: Inspection points and acceptance criteria
