# PMI — Assemblies with Product Manufacturing Information

## Purpose

JT files for assemblies with embedded Product Manufacturing Information (PMI). Includes assembly-level GD&T, annotations, and manufacturing specifications.

## What to Store

- Assemblies with embedded PMI
- Assembly-level GD&T
- Interface dimensions and tolerances
- Assembly notes and callouts
- Mating conditions and requirements

## Content Included

- ✅ Assembly geometry (tessellated)
- ✅ Assembly-level PMI annotations
- ✅ Interface GD&T and tolerances
- ✅ Assembly dimensions
- ✅ Mating requirements
- ✅ Installation instructions
- ✅ Torque specifications

## Usage

Use assembly PMI files for:
- Manufacturing assembly planning
- Supplier coordination packages
- Assembly inspection planning
- Quality control verification
- Interface control documentation
- Installation and integration reviews

## Requirements

- Export from CAD system with PMI capability
- JT version 9.5 or later
- Validate PMI visibility in JT2Go
- Include all critical assembly dimensions
- Coordinate with interface control documents
