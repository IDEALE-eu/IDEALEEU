# EFFECTIVITY: SIM-ALL (TEST OPS_TRAINER)

## Purpose
Configuration effectivity for all operations trainer simulators.

## Scope
- **Configuration Type:** TEST (OPS_TRAINER)
- **Mode:** SIM (Simulation)
- **Version:** HEAD (Development - Mutable)
- **Simulator Range:** All simulator configurations
- **Status:** Active Development

## Training Program
Simulator configurations for crew training and operations development:
- Full flight simulators (FFS)
- Flight training devices (FTD)
- Cockpit procedures trainers
- Mission simulators

## Configuration Content
Simulator configuration data including:
- Cockpit and systems representation
- Flight dynamics model
- Visual system specifications
- Motion system specifications
- Instructor station configuration
- Training scenario definitions

## Base Configuration
Inherits from: CONF/BASELINE/ or CONF/VARIANT/ via VERSION/Q100/00-CONFIG/BLOCKS

## Simulators
- SIM-001: Level D Full Flight Simulator
- SIM-002: Flight Training Device
- SIM-003: Procedures Trainer
- Additional simulators as deployed

## Usage
Reference this effectivity for:
- Simulator qualification
- Training program development
- Simulator configuration management
- Software and hardware specifications

## Owner
Training Systems & Simulation Engineering

## Notes
This is a development version (HEAD) updated as simulator configurations evolve. Simulator qualification freezes are documented separately.
