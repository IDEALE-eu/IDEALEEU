# EFFECTIVITY: FT-0001-0099 (TEST LOADS_DEV)

## Purpose
Configuration effectivity for flight test articles used in loads development testing.

## Scope
- **Configuration Type:** TEST (LOADS_DEV)
- **Mode:** FTI (Flight Test Instrumentation)
- **Version:** R01 (Frozen Test Configuration)
- **Test Article Range:** FT-0001 through FT-0099
- **Status:** Active Testing

## Test Program
Flight test articles for structural loads development and certification:
- Static load testing
- Fatigue testing
- Structural certification testing
- Development flight testing

## Configuration Content
Test article configuration data including:

- FT-0002 through FT-0099: Additional test articles as needed

## Usage
Reference this effectivity for:
- Loads development test planning
- Test article configuration control
- Instrumentation specifications
- Test data correlation

## Owner
Test Engineering & Loads Group

## Notes
This is a frozen test configuration (R01). Test article modifications require proper approval and documentation.
