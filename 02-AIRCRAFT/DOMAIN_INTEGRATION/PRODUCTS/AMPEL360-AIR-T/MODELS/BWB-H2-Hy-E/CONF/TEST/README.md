# TEST — Test and Development Configurations

This directory contains test and development configurations for the BWB-H2-Hy-E aircraft model.

## Purpose

TEST configurations represent specialized configurations for:
- Development testing
- Certification testing
- Training systems
- Ground test articles
- Simulation environments

These configurations may deviate from production standards and are specifically identified by test article designations.

## Integration

Test configurations integrate with:
- **Base Configuration** - `CONF/BASELINE/`
- **Test Planning** - Test program management
- **Certification** - Certification test requirements
- **Training** - Training program requirements

## Change Control

Test configuration changes:
- Follow standard ECR process
- May have expedited approval for test urgency
- Changes documented in test reports
- Traceability to test requirements

## Test Article Tracking

Each test article must have:
- Unique identifier (FT-xxxx, SIM-xxxx)
- Configuration baseline
- Modification record
- Test history
- Disposition plan

## Certification Testing

Test configurations for certification must:
