# SEQUENCE — Installation Sequence

## Purpose

This directory contains documentation of the installation sequence, step-by-step procedures, and visual aids for center body installation operations.

## Directory Structure

### STEPS/
Detailed step-by-step installation procedures and work instructions.

### ANIMATIONS/
Visual animations and simulations of the installation sequence.

## Content Types

- **Installation sequence documents** — Overall installation order and logic
- **Step-by-step procedures** — Detailed work instructions
- **Sequence diagrams** — Flow charts and process maps
- **Critical path analysis** — Timing and dependencies
- **Animation files** — 3D animated installation sequences

## Sequence Planning

### Installation Phases
1. Pre-installation preparation
2. Initial positioning and alignment
3. Temporary support installation
4. Interface connection
5. Fastener installation
6. Sealant application
7. Systems integration
8. Inspection and verification
9. Final closeout

### Critical Dependencies
- Prerequisite work completion
- Material and tool availability
- Equipment readiness
- Personnel qualification
- Environmental conditions
- Inspection hold points

## Naming Convention

```
SEQ_53-10_INSTALL_<interface>_<phase>_v<version>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `SEQ_53-10_INSTALL_COMPLETE_MASTER-SEQUENCE_v001.pdf`
- `SEQ_53-10_INSTALL_WING-ATTACH_DETAIL-STEPS_v002.pdf`
- `SEQ_53-10_INSTALL_OVERVIEW_ANIMATION_v001.mp4`

## Sequence Documentation

Each sequence document should include:
- Operation identification
- Sequence step number
- Description of work
- Required personnel (number and skill level)
- Required tools and equipment
- Required materials
- Time duration estimate
- Prerequisites
- Follow-on work
- Inspection requirements
- Safety considerations

## Sequence Logic

### Linear Sequences
- Sequential operations
- One step follows another
- Clear start and end points
- Simple dependency chains

### Parallel Sequences
- Concurrent operations
- Multiple work streams
- Resource optimization
- Coordination requirements

### Conditional Sequences
- Decision points
- Alternative paths
- Contingency procedures
- Exception handling

## Installation Steps

### Step Documentation
- Unique step identifier
- Step title/description
- Detailed work instructions
- Visual aids (photos, drawings)
- Tool requirements
- Material requirements
- Quality checkpoints
- Safety warnings
- Time estimate
- Personnel requirements

### Step Dependencies
- Predecessor steps
- Successor steps
- Parallel activities
- Waiting periods (cure times, etc.)

### Hold Points
- Inspection hold points
- Engineering review points
- Cure time holds
- Material readiness holds
- Environmental condition holds

## Critical Path

### Path Analysis
