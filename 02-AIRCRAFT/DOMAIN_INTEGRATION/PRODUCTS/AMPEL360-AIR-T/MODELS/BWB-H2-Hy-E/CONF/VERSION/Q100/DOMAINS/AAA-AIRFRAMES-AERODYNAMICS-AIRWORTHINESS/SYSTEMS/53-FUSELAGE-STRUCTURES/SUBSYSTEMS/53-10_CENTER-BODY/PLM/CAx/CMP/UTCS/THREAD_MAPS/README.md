# Digital Thread Maps

[← Back to UTCS](../README.md) | [↑ Up to CMP](../../README.md)

Digital thread connectivity maps for composite materials lifecycle.

## Purpose

Visualize information flow:
- Requirements to design
- Design to analysis
- Analysis to manufacturing
- Manufacturing to verification

## Thread Map Elements

### Upstream Links
- System requirements
- Subsystem requirements
- Design requirements
- Manufacturing requirements

### Downstream Links
- Design artifacts
- Analysis results
- Manufacturing data
- Test results

## Thread Visualization

```
Requirements → Design → Analysis → Manufacturing → Test → Certification
