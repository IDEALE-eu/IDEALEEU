- **Vibration isolators**: Damping mounts for equipment
- **Cable/pipe supports**: Routing supports near equipment
- **Access provisions**: Removable panels or covers
- **Grounding provisions**: Electrical bonding points

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern for mounting unit assemblies:
```
53-10_ASM_MOUNT_<system>-<equipment>-<location>_v<version>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_ASM_MOUNT_ECS-PACK-FWD_v01.CATProduct`
- `53-10_ASM_MOUNT_AVIONICS-RACK-01_v02.asm`
- `53-10_ASM_MOUNT_GALLEY-AFT-RIGHT_v01.sldasm`

## Design Considerations

### Load Analysis
- Determine equipment weight and CG
- Calculate operating loads (vibration, maneuvering)
- Design for ultimate loads (1.5x limit loads typical)
- Include crash loads (emergency landing conditions)
- Validate fatigue life for vibrating equipment

### Attachment Design
- Design for accessible fastener installation
- Include provisions for equipment removal
- Design for adjustment and shimming
- Specify torque requirements
- Include locking features for critical fasteners

### Vibration Isolation
For vibrating equipment:
- Specify isolator type and characteristics
- Design for isolator deflection and travel
- Include snubbers for overload protection
- Validate natural frequency separation
- Design for fail-safe (isolator failure) condition

## Integration Points

Mounting units interface with:
- **Frame sections**: Bracket-to-frame attachments
- **Floor modules**: Floor-mounted equipment
- **Bulkhead modules**: Bulkhead-mounted equipment
- **Skin panels**: Skin-mounted attachments (rare)
- **Systems installations**: Cable and pipe routing to/from equipment

## Load Paths

Equipment mounting loads:
- **Vertical loads**: Equipment weight (1g to 16g emergency)
- **Lateral loads**: Maneuvering and turbulence (typically 3-6g)
- **Longitudinal loads**: Braking and acceleration (9g forward emergency)
- **Vibration loads**: Cyclic loads from operating equipment
- **Thermal loads**: Thermal expansion of equipment and structure
