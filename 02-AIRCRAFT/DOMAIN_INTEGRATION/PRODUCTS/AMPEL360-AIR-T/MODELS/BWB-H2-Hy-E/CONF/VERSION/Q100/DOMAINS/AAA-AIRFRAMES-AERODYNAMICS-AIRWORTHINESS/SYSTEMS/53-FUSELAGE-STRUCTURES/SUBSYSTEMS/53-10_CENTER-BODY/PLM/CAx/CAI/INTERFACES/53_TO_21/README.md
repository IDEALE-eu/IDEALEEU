# 53_TO_21 — Interfaces to ATA-21 (Air Conditioning)

## Purpose

Interface definitions between the 53-10 CENTER-BODY structure and ATA-21 Air Conditioning systems, including environmental control, pressurization, and ventilation.

## Interface Scope

- Equipment mounting provisions
- Duct routing and penetrations
- Pressurization boundary seals
- Thermal insulation attachment
- Moisture control and drainage

## Content Types

- **Mounting Interface Specifications** — Equipment support structures
- **Penetration Definitions** — Duct pass-throughs and sealing
- **Pressurization Boundary Maps** — Seal locations and requirements
- **Clearance Envelopes** — Equipment and duct routing spaces

## File Formats

- `.pdf` — ICDs and installation specifications
- `.step` — 3D equipment mounting geometry
- `.csv` — Penetration schedules
- `.xlsx` — Seal interface matrices

## Key Interface Points

1. **Air Conditioning Pack Mounts** — Primary equipment supports
2. **Distribution Duct Routing** — Main air supply paths
3. **Pressurization Seal Interfaces** — Cabin pressure boundary
4. **Thermal Insulation Attachment** — Blanket and pad mounting
5. **Drain Masts and Overboard Vents** — Moisture removal

## Pressurization Boundary

Critical sealing interfaces:
- Pressure bulkhead seals
- Door and hatch seals
- Equipment penetrations
- Duct connections

## Validation Requirements

- Structural adequacy for equipment loads
- Pressure decay testing (leak rate)
- Thermal insulation effectiveness
- Vibration isolation verification
- Clearance validation (installation and maintenance)

## Change Control

Interface changes require:
- Review by environmental systems team
- ECO via [CHANGE_CONTROL/ECO](../../CHANGE_CONTROL/ECO/README.md)
- Pressure vessel re-certification if boundary affected
- Update to [INTERFACE_MATRIX](../../INTERFACE_MATRIX/README.md)
