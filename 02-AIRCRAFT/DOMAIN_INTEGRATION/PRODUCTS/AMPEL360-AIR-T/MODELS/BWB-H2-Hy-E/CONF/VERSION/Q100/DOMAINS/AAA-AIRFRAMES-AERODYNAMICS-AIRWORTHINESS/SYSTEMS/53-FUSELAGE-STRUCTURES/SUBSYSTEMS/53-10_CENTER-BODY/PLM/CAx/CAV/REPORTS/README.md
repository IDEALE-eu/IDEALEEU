# REPORTS — Test Reporting

## Purpose

This directory consolidates all test reports, correlation studies, and certification evidence packages for the 53-10 CENTER-BODY subsystem validation program.

## Directory Structure

### TEST_REPORTS/
Individual test execution reports documenting procedures, results, and compliance for each test campaign.

**Contents**:
- Qualification Test Reports (QTRs) from `../../PROCEDURES/QTR/`
- Campaign summary reports
- Individual test run reports
- Quick-look data summaries
- Anomaly investigation reports

**Naming**: `[REPORT_TYPE]-53-10-[ID]-[DATE].pdf`

### CORRELATION_REPORTS/
Test-to-analysis correlation reports comparing test results to analytical predictions (FEA, CFD).

**Contents**:
- Pre-test prediction reports
- Post-test correlation analyses
- Model validation studies
- Discrepancy investigations
- Model tuning recommendations

**Typical Reports**:
- Static test vs. FEA correlation
- Fatigue life vs. analysis correlation
- Thermal analysis vs. test correlation
- Modal test vs. FEA correlation

### CERTIFICATION/
Certification evidence packages compiled for certification authority submission.

**Contents**:
- Compliance summary reports
- Certification test plans
- Certification test reports
- Type Certificate Data Sheets (TCDS) support
- Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) packages
- Certification review presentations

**Organization**:
- By certification requirement (CS-25.305, CS-25.613, etc.)
- By certification milestone (Type Inspection Authorization, Type Certificate)
- By certification authority (EASA, FAA)

## Report Standards

### All Reports Must Include:

   - Distribution list

2. **Executive Summary**
   - Objectives
   - Key findings
   - Compliance statement
   - Recommendations (if any)

3. **Body**
   - Detailed results
   - Analysis and discussion
   - Supporting data and figures

4. **Conclusions**
   - Summary of findings

- **Data**: Embed or link to data sources
- **Signatures**: Digital signatures for approval chain

## Approval Workflow

1. **Draft** — Author prepares initial draft
2. **Peer Review** — Technical review by independent engineer
3. **Test Lead Review** — Review by Test Engineering Lead
4. **Engineering Review** — Review by Chief Engineer
5. **QA Review** — Quality assurance verification
6. **Final Approval** — Sign-off by authorized approvers
7. **Distribution** — Release to stakeholders and archive

## Report Distribution

- **Internal**: Project team, engineering, quality, management
- **Customer**: As specified in contract
- **Certification Authority**: Certification packages and supporting data
- **Archive**: Company records management system

## Revision Control

- Reports under configuration management
- Revisions tracked with revision history
- Previous revisions archived with current version
- Major revisions require re-approval
