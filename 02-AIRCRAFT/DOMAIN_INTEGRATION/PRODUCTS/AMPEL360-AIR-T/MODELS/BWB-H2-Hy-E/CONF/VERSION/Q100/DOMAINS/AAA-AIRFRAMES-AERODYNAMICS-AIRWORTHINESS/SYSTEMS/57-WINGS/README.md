# 57-WINGS — Wing Structures

## System Overview

**Description:** ATA Chapter 57 Wing Structures system for the BWB-H2-Hy-E aircraft configuration.

**System ID:** 57  
**Interface Matrix:** See [INTERFACE_MATRIX/](./INTERFACE_MATRIX/) for interface definitions.

## Purpose

This system encompasses all structural aspects of the wing including primary structure, secondary structure, control surface supports, and system integration provisions. For the Blended Wing-Body (BWB) configuration, the wing structure is integral to the fuselage design and includes the center-body integration.

## Subsystems

The 57-WINGS system is organized into the following subsystems:

- [57-00_STANDARDS_GENERAL](./SUBSYSTEMS/57-00_STANDARDS_GENERAL/) — Standards and general requirements
- [57-10_WING_BOX_PRIMARY_STRUCTURE](./SUBSYSTEMS/57-10_WING_BOX_PRIMARY_STRUCTURE/) — Wing box primary structure
- [57-20_SPARS_FRONT_REAR](./SUBSYSTEMS/57-20_SPARS_FRONT_REAR/) — Front and rear spar structures
- [57-30_RIBS_STRINGERS](./SUBSYSTEMS/57-30_RIBS_STRINGERS/) — Ribs and stringers
- [57-40_SKINS_PANELS_TE_LE](./SUBSYSTEMS/57-40_SKINS_PANELS_TE_LE/) — Wing skins, panels, trailing edge and leading edge
- [57-50_HL_DEV_SUPPORTS_TRACKS_HINGES](./SUBSYSTEMS/57-50_HL_DEV_SUPPORTS_TRACKS_HINGES/) — High-lift device supports (structure only; kinematics in ATA-27)
- [57-60_WING_TIPS_WINGLETS](./SUBSYSTEMS/57-60_WING_TIPS_WINGLETS/) — Wing tips and winglets
- [57-70_LEADING_EDGE_STRUCT_ICE_PROVISIONS](./SUBSYSTEMS/57-70_LEADING_EDGE_STRUCT_ICE_PROVISIONS/) — Leading edge structural ice provisions (IF with ATA-30)
- [57-80_FUEL_TANK_STRUCTURE_IF_28](./SUBSYSTEMS/57-80_FUEL_TANK_STRUCTURE_IF_28/) — Fuel tank structural aspects (IF with ATA-28)
- [57-90_ACCESS_PANELS_FAIRINGS](./SUBSYSTEMS/57-90_ACCESS_PANELS_FAIRINGS/) — Access panels and fairings
- [57-95_SENSOR_BRACKETS_EWIS_PROVISIONS_IF_92](./SUBSYSTEMS/57-95_SENSOR_BRACKETS_EWIS_PROVISIONS_IF_92/) — Sensor brackets and EWIS provisions (IF with ATA-92)

## System Interfaces

The [Interface Matrix](./INTERFACE_MATRIX/) directory contains CSV files defining interfaces with other systems.

## BWB-Specific Considerations

For the Blended Wing-Body (BWB-H2-Hy-E) configuration:

- Wing structure seamlessly integrates with center-body fuselage
- Load paths distribute across the blended wing-body interface
- Critical structural interface with ATA-53 (Fuselage Structures)
- Larger wing surface area for lift and payload integration
- Unique considerations for hydrogen fuel tank integration

## Compliance

- **Standards:** Follow ATA iSpec 2200 and project-specific guidelines
- **ICDs:** see `00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/09-INTERFACES/`
- **Baselines & Changes:** `00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/04-BASELINES/`
