# BULKHEADS â€” Pressure and Non-Pressure Bulkheads

## Purpose

CAD models for bulkheads that separate fuselage compartments and withstand pressure loads.

## Bulkhead Types

- Forward pressure bulkhead
- Aft pressure bulkhead
- Intermediate bulkheads
- Fire bulkheads
- Cargo divider bulkheads
- Non-pressure partitions

## Naming Convention

```
53-10_BULKHEAD_<TYPE>_<STATION>_v<VERSION>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_BULKHEAD_FWD-PRESSURE_BH-001_v01.CATPart`
- `53-10_BULKHEAD_AFT-PRESSURE_BH-099_v02.prt`

## Design Requirements

- Withstand pressure differential
- Provide structural closure
- Support floor and systems loads
- Include access provisions
- Meet damage tolerance requirements
