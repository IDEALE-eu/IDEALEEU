[â†‘ Up to CMP](../README.md)

Cost management and Earned Value Management (EVM) for composite materials subsystem (53-10 Center Body).

## Structure

- **[BUDGET/](BUDGET/)** - Budget baseline and allocations
- **[EVM/](EVM/)** - Earned Value Management data ([PV/EV/AC](EVM/PV_EV_AC/))
- **[FORECAST/](FORECAST/)** - Cost forecasts ([EAC](FORECAST/EAC/), [ETC](FORECAST/ETC/))
