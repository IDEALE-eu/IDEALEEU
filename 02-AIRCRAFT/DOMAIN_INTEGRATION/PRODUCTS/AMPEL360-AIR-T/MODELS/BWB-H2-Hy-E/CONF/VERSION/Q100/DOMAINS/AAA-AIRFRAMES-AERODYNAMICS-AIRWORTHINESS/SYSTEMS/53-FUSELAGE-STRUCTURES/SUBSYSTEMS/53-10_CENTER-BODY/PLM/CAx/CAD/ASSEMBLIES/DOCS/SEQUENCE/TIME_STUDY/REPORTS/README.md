## Time Study Analysis

### Statistical Analysis
- Average times
- Standard deviation
- Confidence intervals
- Sample adequacy
- Outlier identification

### Performance Analysis
- Operator performance rating
- Efficiency calculations
- Utilization rates
- Variance analysis

## Standard Time Format

### Standard Time Components
```
Standard Time = (Observed Time × Rating Factor) × (1 + Allowances)

Where:
- Observed Time: Average measured time
- Rating Factor: Operator pace factor (e.g., 1.0 = normal)
- Allowances: Personal, fatigue, delay (e.g., 15%)
```

### Example
```
Operation: Frame F05 Installation
Observed Time: 120 minutes
Rating Factor: 1.05 (above average pace)
Normal Time: 120 × 1.05 = 126 minutes
Allowances: 15%
Standard Time: 126 × 1.15 = 145 minutes
```
