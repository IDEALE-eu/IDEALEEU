# FWD — Forward Zone

## Purpose
DXF files for forward zone components and assemblies.

## Contents
- Forward section frames and ribs
- Forward skin panels
- Forward bulkheads
- Forward fittings and brackets
- Interface drawings with center zone

## Zone Boundaries
**Forward zone extends**:
- From nose/cockpit interface
- To forward center zone interface
- Includes forward structural elements

## Structural Components
Typical parts in forward zone:
- Forward frames (primary structure)
- Skin panels and doublers
- Forward pressure bulkhead
- Nose gear support structure (if applicable)
- Windscreen/canopy interface structure
- Forward systems support brackets

## File Naming
```
53-10_FWD_<component>_<type>_<revision>_<date>.dxf
```

Examples:
- `53-10_FWD_FRAME-F01_PROFILE_A_20250110.dxf`
- `53-10_FWD_SKIN-SP01_FLAT_A_20250110.dxf`
- `53-10_FWD_BULKHEAD-BH01_ASSEMBLY_B_20250110.dxf`

## Interface Requirements
Document interfaces with:
- **Center zone**: Structural attachments and load paths
- **Cockpit/nose section**: Forward interface
- **Systems**: Avionics, environmental control
- **Landing gear**: If nose gear is in this zone

## Manufacturing Considerations
- Access for assembly and installation
- Tooling and fixture requirements
- Assembly sequence
- Inspection access
- System installation clearances
