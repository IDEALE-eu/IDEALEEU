# WINDOW_BAYS â€” Window Cutout Reinforcements

## Purpose

This directory contains CAD part files for window bay structures and reinforcements used in the 53-10 Center Body subsystem. Window bays provide structural reinforcement around window cutouts and support window installation.

## Component Description

### Window Bay Types
- **Cabin windows**: Passenger viewing windows
- **Cockpit windows**: Flight deck windows
- **Observation windows**: Special observation or inspection windows
- **Emergency exit windows**: Emergency egress window openings

### Components
- **Window frames**: Structural frame around window opening
- **Doublers**: Local reinforcement plates
- **Reveal members**: Inner and outer edge trim
- **Corner radii**: Reinforced corner sections
- **Mounting provisions**: Window glass retention features

## Naming Convention

```
53-10_WINDOW-BAY_<window-type>_<location>_<version>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_WINDOW-BAY_CABIN_LEFT-F10_v01.CATPart`
- `53-10_WINDOW-BAY_COCKPIT_FWD-LEFT_v02.prt`
- `53-10_WINDOW-BAY_EMER-EXIT_RIGHT_v01.sldprt`

## Design Considerations

### Structural Requirements
- Restore stiffness and strength around window cutout
- Provide continuous load path around opening
- Transfer cabin pressure loads to fuselage structure
- Support window panel and prevent stress concentrations

### Material Specifications
- **Aluminum**: 7075-T6 or 2024-T3 for frames and doublers
- **Titanium**: Ti-6Al-4V for high-stress areas
- **Edge treatments**: Anodized or corrosion-resistant coatings

### Design Features
- Generous corner radii to minimize stress concentration
- Drainage provisions for condensation
- Seal retention features
- Lightning strike protection provisions
