# LOD_HIGH — High Level of Detail Parts

## Purpose

High level of detail (LOD) JT files for individual parts. These files contain full-detail geometry for close inspection and detailed review.

## What to Store

- High-resolution part geometry
- High polygon count (fine tessellation)
- Maximum visual fidelity
- All features and details visible

## Usage

Use high LOD parts when:
- Detailed design reviews
- Close inspection required
- Manufacturing reviews
- Quality verification
- Documentation and archival

## File Characteristics

- **File size**: Largest (typically 1-5 MB per part)
- **Polygon count**: High (fine tessellation)
- **Detail level**: Full detail, all features visible
- **Load time**: Slower

## Best Practices

- Use for critical components requiring detailed inspection
- Suitable for manufacturing and quality reviews
- May require higher-performance viewing systems
- Consider file size impact on storage and distribution
