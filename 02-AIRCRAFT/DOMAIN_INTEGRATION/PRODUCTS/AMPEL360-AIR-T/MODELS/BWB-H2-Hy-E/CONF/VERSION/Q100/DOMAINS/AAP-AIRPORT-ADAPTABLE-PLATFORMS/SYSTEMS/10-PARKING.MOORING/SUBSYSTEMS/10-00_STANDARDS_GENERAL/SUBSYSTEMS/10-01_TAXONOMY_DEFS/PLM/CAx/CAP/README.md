# CAP - Computer-Aided Process Planning

[â†‘ Up to 10-01_TAXONOMY_DEFS](../../../README.md)

Computer-Aided Process Planning artifacts for taxonomy definitions and classification standards.

## Purpose

Process planning, work instructions, and manufacturing sequences supporting the development, verification, and deployment of taxonomy definitions and classification standards.

## Structure

- **PROCESS_PLANS/** - Manufacturing process plans
- **WORK_INSTRUCTIONS/** - Detailed work instructions
- **SEQUENCES/** - Operation sequences and flow
- **RESOURCES/** - Resource requirements (labor, equipment)
- **TIMING/** - Process timing and cycle time analysis
- **QUALITY/** - Quality control points and inspections
- **STANDARDS/** - Process standards and best practices

## Key Artifacts

- Process flow diagrams
- Work instruction documents
- Manufacturing sequences
- Resource allocation plans
- Cycle time analyses

## Naming Convention

```
