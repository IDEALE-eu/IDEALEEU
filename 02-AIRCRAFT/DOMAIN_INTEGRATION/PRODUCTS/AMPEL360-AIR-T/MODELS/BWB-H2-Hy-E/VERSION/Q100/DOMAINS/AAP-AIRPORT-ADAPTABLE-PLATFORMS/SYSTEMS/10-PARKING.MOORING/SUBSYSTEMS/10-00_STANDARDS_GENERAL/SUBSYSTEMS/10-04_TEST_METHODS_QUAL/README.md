# Subsystem: 10-04_TEST_METHODS_QUAL

## Description

Test methods and qualification standards for airport parking and mooring equipment.

This subsystem defines standardized test procedures, acceptance criteria, and qualification requirements for all parking and mooring system components. Includes functional testing, environmental qualification, reliability testing, and certification processes.

## Parent System

[10-00_STANDARDS_GENERAL](../../) - Standards and general requirements subsystem.

## PLM Structure

This subsystem contains engineering artifacts organized by CAx discipline:

### Engineering BOM
- [EBOM_LINKS.md](./PLM/EBOM_LINKS.md) - Links to authoritative ERP/PLM items

### CAx Directories

- [CAD/](./PLM/CAx/CAD/) - Computer-Aided Design (3D models, drawings)
- [CAE/](./PLM/CAx/CAE/) - Computer-Aided Engineering (FEA, analysis)
- [CAO/](./PLM/CAx/CAO/) - Computer-Aided Optimization (design optimization)
- [CAM/](./PLM/CAx/CAM/) - Computer-Aided Manufacturing (NC programming, tooling)
- [CAI/](./PLM/CAx/CAI/) - Computer-Aided Installation (installation drawings, procedures)
- [CAV/](./PLM/CAx/CAV/) - Computer-Aided Validation (test models, validation data)
- [CAP/](./PLM/CAx/CAP/) - Computer-Aided Process Planning (process plans, work instructions)
- [CAS/](./PLM/CAx/CAS/) - Computer-Aided Simulation (system simulations)
- [CMP/](./PLM/CAx/CMP/) - Composite Materials Processing (layup data, curing)

## Working with This Subsystem

### Adding Engineering Artifacts
1. Place files in appropriate CAx subdirectory based on discipline
2. Use neutral formats (STEP, JT, glTF) alongside native where possible
3. Update `PLM/EBOM_LINKS.md` with ERP/PLM references
4. Follow naming conventions: `{PART_ID}_{DESCRIPTION}_{REV}.{ext}`

### BOM Management
Update [PLM/EBOM_LINKS.md](./PLM/EBOM_LINKS.md) with:
- Part numbers and sourcing information
- Links to authoritative PLM/ERP systems
- Configuration control references
- Supplier information

### File Formats
- **CAD**: STEP, JT, native CAD formats
- **CAE**: Nastran, ANSYS, solver input/output
- **CAM**: CNC programs, tooling definitions
- **Documents**: PDF for controlled documents

## Key Design Considerations

- Functional test procedures for all subsystems
- Environmental qualification (temperature, humidity, vibration)
- Reliability and durability testing standards
- Acceptance criteria and pass/fail thresholds
- Certification and compliance documentation
- Test equipment specifications and calibration
- Quality assurance protocols
