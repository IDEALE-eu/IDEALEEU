# Aeroelasticity Analysis

This directory stores aeroelastic stability and response analyses.

## Purpose
- Flutter analysis (subsonic/transonic)
- Divergence and control reversal
- Dynamic aeroelastic response
- Gust loads and buffeting

## Guidelines
- Document flight envelope and speed range
- Include modal analysis results
- Reference CS-25 dynamic requirements
- Archive unsteady aerodynamic data
