# 51-20 MANUFACTURING PROCESSES — Structures (BWB-H2-Hy-E, Q100)

**Under System:** 51-STRUCTURES-GENERAL • **Architecture:** BWB-H2-Hy-E • **Domain:** AAA-AIRFRAMES-AERODYNAMICS-AIRWORTHINESS

## Purpose
Define approved manufacturing processes, process specifications, and manufacturing-induced effects on structural performance.

## Deliverables
- Manufacturing process specifications (forming, machining, drilling)
- Process control plans and quality requirements
- Manufacturing-induced residual stress analysis
- Tooling and fixture standards
- Quality inspection procedures

## Interfaces
- **51-00 General**: Manufacturing process standards
- **51-10 Materials**: Material processability limits
- **51-30 Fasteners/Joints**: Hole preparation and fastener installation
- **51-40 Corrosion**: Surface preparation for coating
- Manufacturing suppliers and production facilities

## PLM/CAx
- `PLM/CAx/CAM/` — NC programs and tooling designs
- `PLM/CAx/CAE/` — Manufacturing simulation and residual stress
- `PLM/CAx/CAV/` — Process validation test results

## CM & Compliance
- Process changes via ECR/ECO (CCB)
- Manufacturing deviations require structural assessment
- Supplier qualification and process audits
