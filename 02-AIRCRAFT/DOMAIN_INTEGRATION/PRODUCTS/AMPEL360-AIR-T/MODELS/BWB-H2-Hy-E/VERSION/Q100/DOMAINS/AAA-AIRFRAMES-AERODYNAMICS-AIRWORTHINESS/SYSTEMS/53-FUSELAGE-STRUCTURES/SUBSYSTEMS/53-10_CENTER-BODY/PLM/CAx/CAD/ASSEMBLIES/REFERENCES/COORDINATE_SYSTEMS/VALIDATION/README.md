# VALIDATION — Coordinate System Validation

## Purpose

This directory contains validation checks, test cases, and reports for verifying the correctness and consistency of all coordinate system definitions used in the 53-10 Center Body.

## Contents

### CHECKS/
Validation check definitions and test cases:
- Transformation matrix validation (orthogonality, determinant)
- Consistency checks between coordinate systems
- Tolerance verification
- Right-hand rule compliance
- Parent-child relationship validation
- Interface alignment verification

### REPORTS/
Validation reports and results:
- Automated validation reports
- Manual inspection results
- First article measurement reports
- Interface fit-check reports
- Discrepancy reports and resolutions
- Validation test logs

## Validation Categories

### Mathematical Validation
- **Orthogonality**: R·R^T = I (for rotation matrices)
- **Determinant**: Det(R) = +1 (proper rotation, preserves handedness)
- **Inverse**: T^(-1) exists and is numerically stable
- **Composition**: Chained transformations produce correct results
- **Precision**: Numerical accuracy ≤ 1e-6

### Physical Validation
- **Measurability**: Coordinate system features are physically accessible
- **Repeatability**: Re-establishment yields consistent results
- **Stability**: Datums are stable and not subject to deformation
- **Manufacturability**: Can be created within tolerance
- **Inspectability**: Can be measured with available equipment

### Interface Validation
- **Alignment**: Mating coordinate systems align within tolerance
- **Compatibility**: Transformations between systems are consistent
- **Closure**: Interface loops close mathematically
- **Load path**: Coordinate systems align with load transfer
- **Assembly**: Physical assembly is possible with defined clearances

## Validation Process

### Stage 1: Design Validation (CAD)
1. Define coordinate system in CAD
2. Document origin and axes
3. Create transformation to parent coordinate system
4. Run automated validation checks
5. Review and approve by design engineer

### Stage 2: Analysis Validation (CAE)
1. Import coordinate system to analysis tools
2. Verify transformation accuracy
3. Check load application directions
4. Validate boundary condition setup
5. Review by analysis engineer

### Stage 3: Manufacturing Validation (CAM)
1. Convert to manufacturing coordinate system
2. Verify tooling alignment
3. Validate NC programming references
4. Check inspection setup
5. Review by manufacturing engineer

### Stage 4: Physical Validation (Inspection)
1. Measure as-built coordinate system features
2. Compare to design intent
3. Document deviations
4. Evaluate acceptance criteria
5. Sign-off by quality assurance

## Validation Tools

### Automated Checks
- Python validation scripts (`validate_coordinate_systems.py`)
- MATLAB verification functions
- CAD system built-in checks
- CMM measurement programs

### Manual Checks
- Visual inspection procedures
- Physical fit checks
- Optical alignment verification
- Laser tracker surveys

## Acceptance Criteria

Coordinate systems are accepted if:
- All mathematical validations pass (Det = 1, orthogonality < 1e-6)
- Physical features are within tolerance (±0.1mm typical)
- Interface alignments are within specification
- Documentation is complete and approved
- All validation reports are filed

## Non-Conformance

If validation fails:
1. Document the non-conformance
2. Perform root cause analysis
3. Propose corrective action
4. Implement correction (with ECR if needed)
5. Re-validate
6. Update documentation

## Validation Schedule

- **Design phase**: Every coordinate system definition
