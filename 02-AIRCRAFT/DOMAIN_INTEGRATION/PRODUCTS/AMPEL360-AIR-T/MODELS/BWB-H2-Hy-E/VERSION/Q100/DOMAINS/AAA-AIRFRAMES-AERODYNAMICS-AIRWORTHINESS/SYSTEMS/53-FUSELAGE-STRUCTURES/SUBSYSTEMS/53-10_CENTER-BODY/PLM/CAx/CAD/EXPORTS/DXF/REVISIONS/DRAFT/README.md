# DRAFT ‚Äî Draft DXF Files

## Purpose
Work-in-progress and draft DXF files not yet released for manufacturing.

## Contents
- Draft drawings under development
- Work-in-progress exports
- Files undergoing review
- Test exports and validation files
- Pre-release versions

## File Status
Files in DRAFT are:
- ‚ùå **Not approved** for manufacturing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Under review** or development
- üîÑ **Subject to change** without notice
- üìù **May have errors** or incomplete data

## File Naming
```
<part>_<description>_DRAFT_<date>.dxf
```
or
```
<part>_<description>_WIP_<date>.dxf
```

Examples:
- `53-10-FRM05_FRAME_DRAFT_20250108.dxf`
- `53-10-SKIN10_FLAT_WIP_20250109.dxf`
- `53-10-BRK03_BRACKET_DRAFT-V2_20250110.dxf`

## Usage Guidelines
**DO**:
- Use for design development
- Share for internal review
- Test manufacturing feasibility
- Validate export settings
- Iterate and refine

**DO NOT**:
- Release to manufacturing
- Share with external suppliers without clear draft marking
- Use for production tooling
- Archive as final version

## Review Process
Before moving to RELEASED:
1. Design review completed
2. Engineering approval obtained
3. Manufacturing feasibility confirmed
4. Quality requirements verified
5. Documentation complete
6. File validated and tested

## Related Directories
- **[../RELEASED/](../RELEASED/)** ‚Äî Move here after approval
- **[../OBSOLETE/](../OBSOLETE/)** ‚Äî If draft is abandoned
- **[../../PARTS/](../../PARTS/)** ‚Äî Current working files

## Cleanup
Periodically review and:
- Archive old drafts no longer needed
- Delete duplicate or obsolete drafts
- Move approved files to RELEASED
- Document decisions and changes

## Best Practices
- Clearly mark files as DRAFT
- Include version numbers for iterations
- Document changes and intent
- Keep drafts only as long as needed
- Never use draft files for production
