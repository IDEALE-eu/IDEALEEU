# CAE - Computer-Aided Engineering

[â†‘ Up to 10-02_STAND_GEOMETRY_MARKINGS](../../../README.md)

Computer-Aided Engineering artifacts for airport stand geometry and ground marking standards.

## Purpose

Engineering analysis, FEA models, simulations, and results validation supporting the development, verification, and deployment of airport stand geometry and ground marking standards.

## Structure

- **GEOMETRY/** - Analysis geometry and meshes
- **MODELS/** - FEA models and simulation setups
- **LOADS/** - Load cases and boundary conditions
- **CASES/** - Analysis cases and scenarios
- **RESULTS/** - Solver outputs and post-processing
- **REPORTS/** - Analysis reports and summaries
- **VALIDATION/** - Model validation and correlation data

## Key Artifacts

- FEA models and simulation decks
- Analysis results and post-processing
- Stress, thermal, and modal analysis reports
- Model validation and correlation data
- Solver input/output files

## Naming Convention

```
10-02_{CAX}_{DESCRIPTION}_v{VER}.{ext}
```

## Standards

- Follow applicable CAE standards and best practices
- Ensure traceability to EBOM items
- Maintain configuration control per CM plan
- Document assumptions and validation basis
- Include metadata and revision history

## File Formats

- **Input:** Nastran (.bdf, .dat), ANSYS (.db, .inp), Abaqus (.inp)
- **Output:** Results (.op2, .rst, .odb), Reports (.pdf)
- **Mesh:** Neutral mesh formats (.bdf, .unv)
- **Post:** HyperView, Tecplot, ParaView files

## Traceability

All CAE artifacts must:
- Link to EBOM items in [PLM/EBOM_LINKS.md](../EBOM_LINKS.md)
- Reference requirements and specifications
- Include verification and validation evidence
- Maintain audit trail of changes
- Support configuration management
