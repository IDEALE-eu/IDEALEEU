# CAM - Computer-Aided Manufacturing

[â†‘ Up to 10-02_STAND_GEOMETRY_MARKINGS](../../../README.md)

Computer-Aided Manufacturing artifacts for airport stand geometry and ground marking standards.

## Purpose

Manufacturing processes, NC programming, tooling, and production planning supporting the development, verification, and deployment of airport stand geometry and ground marking standards.

## Structure

- **NC_PROGRAMS/** - CNC programs and tool paths
- **TOOLING/** - Tool designs and specifications
- **FIXTURES/** - Manufacturing fixtures and jigs
- **PROCESSES/** - Manufacturing process definitions
- **SETUP_SHEETS/** - Machine setup instructions
- **INSPECTION/** - Manufacturing inspection plans
- **REPORTS/** - Manufacturing feasibility studies

## Key Artifacts

- CNC programs (G-code, APT)
- Tool path visualizations
- Manufacturing process sheets
- Tooling and fixture designs
- Machining time estimates

## Naming Convention

```
10-02_{CAX}_{DESCRIPTION}_v{VER}.{ext}
```

## Standards

- Follow applicable CAM standards and best practices
- Ensure traceability to EBOM items
- Maintain configuration control per CM plan
- Document assumptions and validation basis
- Include metadata and revision history

## File Formats

- **NC Programs:** G-code, APT, CLDATA
- **CAM:** Native CAM files (NX, Mastercam, etc.)
- **Tooling:** STEP, PDF drawings
- **Reports:** PDF, Excel

## Traceability

All CAM artifacts must:
- Link to EBOM items in [PLM/EBOM_LINKS.md](../EBOM_LINKS.md)
- Reference requirements and specifications
- Include verification and validation evidence
- Maintain audit trail of changes
- Support configuration management
