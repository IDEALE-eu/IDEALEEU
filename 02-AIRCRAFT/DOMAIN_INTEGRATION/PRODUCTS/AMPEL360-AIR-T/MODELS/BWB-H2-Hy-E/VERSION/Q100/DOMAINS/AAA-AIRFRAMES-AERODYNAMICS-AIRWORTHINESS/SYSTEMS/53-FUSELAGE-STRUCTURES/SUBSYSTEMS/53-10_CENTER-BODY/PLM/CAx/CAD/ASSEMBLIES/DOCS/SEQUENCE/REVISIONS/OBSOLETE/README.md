# OBSOLETE — Obsolete Documents

## Purpose

This directory contains superseded assembly sequence documents that have been replaced by newer versions but are retained for historical reference and traceability.

## Contents

### Obsolete Document Types
- Superseded procedures
- Old operation sheets
- Superseded inspection procedures
- Old tooling documentation
- Any document replaced by newer version

## Obsolete Status

### Characteristics
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer version
- **Not for production**: NOT to be used for new assemblies
- **Reference only**: Historical reference and traceability
- **Archived**: Maintained for as-built records

### Usage
- **NOT for production**: Do not use for new assemblies
- As-built traceability: Link to units built with this version
- Historical reference: Understand past configurations
- Audit support: Support audits and investigations
- Legal retention: Maintain per legal requirements

## Naming Convention

Same naming as released, with obsolete indicator:
```
53-10_<document-type>_<description>_<version>_OBSOLETE-<date>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_SEQ_FRAME-INSTALL_v01_OBSOLETE-2024-03-20.pdf`
- `53-10_OP-DETAIL_FASTENING_v02_OBSOLETE-2024-06-15.pdf`

Note: Date indicates when document became obsolete

## Obsolete Document Management

### Transition to Obsolete
When a document is superseded:
1. New version released
2. Old version moved to OBSOLETE
3. Add obsolete date to filename
4. Update document index
5. Communicate to production
6. Complete in-process work per old version

### Obsolete Marking
Documents should be marked:
- "OBSOLETE" watermark (if possible)
- Obsolete date
- Superseded by version number
- Effectivity information preserved

## Retention Requirements

### Retention Period
- **Aerospace**: Typically lifetime of product + X years
- **Legal**: Per legal and regulatory requirements
- **Audit**: Support audit requirements
- **Traceability**: As-built record support

### Storage
- Organized by version
- Indexed for retrieval
- Access controlled
- Backed up per policy

## Traceability

### As-Built Records
Link obsolete documents to:
- Serial numbers of units assembled
- Work orders completed
- Date ranges of usage
- Configuration effectivity

### Historical Reference
Support:
- Root cause analysis
- Warranty investigations
- Accident investigations
- Design evolution tracking

## Document Retrieval

### Accessing Obsolete Documents
- Available for reference only
- Clearly marked as obsolete
- Requires justification for use
- Supervisor approval for reference

### Verification Before Use
If an obsolete document must be referenced:
- Verify correct version for unit/date
- Confirm effectivity applies
- Document reason for reference
- Do NOT use for new production

## Disposal

### When to Dispose
- After retention period expires
- Per document retention policy
- With legal/regulatory approval
- After final archive

### Disposal Process
- Verify retention period met
- Obtain approval for disposal
- Maintain disposal records
- Secure disposal method
