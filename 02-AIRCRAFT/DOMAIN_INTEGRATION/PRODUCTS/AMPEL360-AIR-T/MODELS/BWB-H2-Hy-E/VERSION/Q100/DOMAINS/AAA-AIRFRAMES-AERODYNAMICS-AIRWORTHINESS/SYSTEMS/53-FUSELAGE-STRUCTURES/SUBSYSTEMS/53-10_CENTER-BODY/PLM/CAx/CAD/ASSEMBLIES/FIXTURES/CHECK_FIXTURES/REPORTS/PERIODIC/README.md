# PERIODIC â€” Periodic Inspection Reports

## Purpose

This directory contains periodic inspection reports for ongoing production and maintenance verification.

## Contents

### Report Types
- **Production inspection reports**: Routine part verification
- **Fixture verification reports**: Periodic fixture accuracy checks
- **Process monitoring reports**: Statistical process control
- **Trend analysis reports**: Long-term performance tracking
- **Audit reports**: Internal and external audit findings

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern:
```
PERIODIC_<part-id>_<period>_<version>.pdf
```

Examples:
- `PERIODIC_FRAME-F05_2024-Q1_v01.pdf`
- `PERIODIC_WING-INTERFACE_2024-01_v02.pdf`
- `PERIODIC_FIXTURE-VERIFICATION_2024-Q1_v01.pdf`

## Inspection Frequency

### Standard Frequencies
- **Daily**: High-volume production, critical parts
- **Weekly**: Regular production items
- **Monthly**: Lower volume production
- **Quarterly**: Low volume or stable processes
- **Annual**: Fixture and tooling verification

### Trigger Events
- Scheduled interval
- Process change
- Quality alert
- Customer request
- After corrective action

## Report Contents

Each periodic report should include:
- **Period covered**: Date range
- **Parts inspected**: Part numbers and quantities
- **Inspection results**: Summary of pass/fail
- **Statistical data**: Cp, Cpk, trends
- **Non-conformances**: Issues found
- **Corrective actions**: Actions taken
- **Trends**: Comparison to previous periods
- **Recommendations**: Process improvements
