# LOD_MED — Medium Level of Detail Assemblies

## Purpose

Medium level of detail (LOD) JT files for assemblies. Balanced representation suitable for most assembly visualization needs.

## What to Store

- Medium-resolution assembly geometry
- Balanced component detail
- Standard assembly representations
- General-purpose assembly files

## Usage

Use medium LOD assemblies when:
- Standard design reviews
- Normal collaboration and sharing
- PLM system integration
- Balance between detail and performance
- General distribution to stakeholders

## File Characteristics

- **File size**: Medium (5-50 MB)
- **Component detail**: Balanced geometry
- **Load time**: Moderate
- **Use case**: Standard reviews and collaboration

## Best Practices

- Default LOD for most assembly use cases
- Suitable for engineering reviews
- Good balance for PLM storage
- Recommended for supplier coordination
- Use for design milestone reviews
