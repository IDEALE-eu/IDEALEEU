# SEQUENCE â€” Test Execution Sequences

## Purpose

This directory contains test execution sequences, checkpoints, and documentation for the step-by-step execution of test programs.

## Directory Structure

### STEPS/
Detailed test execution steps:
- Step-by-step test procedures
- Load application sequences
- Measurement point definitions
- Data acquisition triggers
- Hold points and inspections
- Safety checkpoints

### CHECKPOINTS/
Test checkpoint documentation:
- Pre-test readiness checkpoints
- In-process verification points
- Post-step inspection requirements
- Go/no-go decision criteria
- Safety verification checkpoints
- Data quality checkpoints

### ANIMATIONS/
Visual animations and simulations of test sequences:
- Test sequence animations
- Load application visualizations
- Expected deformation animations
- Failure mode animations
- Safety procedure visualizations
- Training materials

## Test Sequence Development

### Planning Phase
1. Define test objectives
2. Identify critical measurement points
3. Establish safety hold points
4. Develop load application sequence
5. Define success/failure criteria

### Sequence Documentation
Each test sequence should include:
- Sequence flow diagram
- Step-by-step instructions
- Load levels and application rates
- Data acquisition parameters
- Safety checkpoints
- Emergency stop criteria

### Validation Phase
- Dry run execution
- Sequence timing verification
- Safety system validation
- Data acquisition verification
- Personnel training completion

## Sequence Execution

### Pre-Test Phase
- Verify test article installation
- Check instrumentation operation
- Validate data acquisition system
- Conduct safety briefing
- Review emergency procedures

### Test Execution Phase
- Execute sequence per procedure
- Monitor real-time data
- Document any deviations
- Perform checkpoint inspections
- Record observations and anomalies

### Post-Test Phase
- Secure test article and rig
- Download and backup data
- Perform post-test inspection
- Document test completion
- Conduct debrief meeting

## Documentation Requirements

- Signed execution checklist
- Time-stamped event log
- Photographic documentation
- Data file references
- Deviation and anomaly reports
- Test conductor notes
