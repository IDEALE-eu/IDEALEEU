# PROBLEMS â€” Optimization Problem Definitions

## Purpose
Define optimization problems for structural design of the center body, including problem formulation, design space, and optimization objectives.

## Contents
- Problem formulation documents (PDF, Markdown)
- Design space definitions
- Optimization problem statements
- Multi-objective optimization setups
- Trade study definitions
- Problem revision history

## Guidelines
- Document all assumptions clearly
- Define design variables with ranges and constraints
- Specify objective functions and their priorities
- Include constraint definitions with rationale
- Reference applicable regulations (CS-25, etc.)
- Link to relevant loads and materials data
- Maintain traceability to requirements
