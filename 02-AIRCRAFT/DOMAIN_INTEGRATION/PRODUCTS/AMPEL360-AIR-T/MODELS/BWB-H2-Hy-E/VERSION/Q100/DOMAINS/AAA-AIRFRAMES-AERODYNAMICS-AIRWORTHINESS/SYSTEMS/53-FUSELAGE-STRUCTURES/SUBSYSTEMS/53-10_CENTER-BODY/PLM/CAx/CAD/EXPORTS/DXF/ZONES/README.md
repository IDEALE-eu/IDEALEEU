# ZONES — Zone-Based Organization

## Purpose
DXF files organized by structural zones of the center body.

## Contents
- **[FWD/](FWD/)** — Forward zone drawings and parts
- **[CTR/](CTR/)** — Center zone drawings and parts
- **[AFT/](AFT/)** — Aft zone drawings and parts

## Zone Definitions
**53-10 Center Body Zones**:
- **FWD (Forward)**: Forward section of center body
- **CTR (Center)**: Mid-section of center body
- **AFT (Aft)**: Aft section of center body

## Organization
Each zone contains:
- Assembly drawings for the zone
- Individual part drawings
- Interface drawings with adjacent zones
- Installation and tooling drawings

## File Naming Convention
```
53-10_<zone>_<component>_<type>_<revision>_<date>.dxf
```

Examples:
- `53-10_FWD_FRAME-01_MACHINING_A_20250110.dxf`
- `53-10_CTR_SKIN-PANEL_FLAT_B_20250110.dxf`
- `53-10_AFT_BULKHEAD_ASSEMBLY_A_20250110.dxf`

## Zone Interfaces
Document interfaces between zones:
- Structural attachment points
- Seal locations
- Fastener patterns
- Load transfer paths
- Inspection access

## Guidelines
- Clearly identify zone boundaries
- Document interface requirements
- Maintain consistent coordinate systems
- Cross-reference adjacent zones
- Include datum references

- **[../ASSEMBLIES/](../ASSEMBLIES/)** — Assembly-level drawings
- **[../INSTALLATION/](../INSTALLATION/)** — Installation procedures

## Best Practices
- Use zone-specific coordinate systems
- Document zone-to-zone interfaces
- Include zone boundary markers
- Reference master geometry
- Coordinate with systems integration
