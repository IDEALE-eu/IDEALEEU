# CERTS â€” Calibration Certificates

## Purpose

This directory contains calibration certificates for check fixtures and inspection equipment.

## Contents

### Certificate Types
- **Fixture calibration certificates**: Check fixture accuracy verification
- **Equipment calibration certificates**: CMM, laser tracker, gauges
- **Reference standard certificates**: Master standards and artifacts
- **Traceability certificates**: Chain of traceability documentation

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern:
```
CERT_<equipment-id>_<cal-date>_<cert-number>.pdf
```

Examples:
- `CERT_FIX-CHECK-F05_2024-01-15_CAL-001234.pdf`
- `CERT_CMM-001_2024-02-20_CAL-002345.pdf`
- `CERT_PIN-GAGE-SET-01_2024-03-10_CAL-003456.pdf`

## Certificate Requirements

Each calibration certificate must include:
- **Certificate number**: Unique identifier
- **Equipment ID**: Device being calibrated
- **Calibration date**: Date of calibration
- **Next due date**: When recalibration is required
- **Calibration laboratory**: Name and accreditation
- **Standards used**: Traceability information
- **Measurement results**: As-found and as-left data
- **Uncertainties**: Measurement uncertainty statement
- **Pass/fail status**: Conformance to specifications
- **Technician signature**: Calibrated by
- **Approval signature**: Reviewed and approved by
