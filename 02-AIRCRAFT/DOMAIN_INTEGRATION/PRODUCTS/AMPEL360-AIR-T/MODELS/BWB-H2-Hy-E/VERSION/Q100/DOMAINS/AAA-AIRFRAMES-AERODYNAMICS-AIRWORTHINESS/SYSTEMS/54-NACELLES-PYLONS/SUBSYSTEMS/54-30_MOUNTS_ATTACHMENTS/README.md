# 54-30 MOUNTS_ATTACHMENTS — Precision Engine Mounting (BWB-H2-Hy-E, Q100)

**Purpose**  
Precision engine mounting systems with advanced vibration isolation for electric motor harmonics and hybrid-electric propulsion load management.

## Scope
- Engine mount structural design and load transfer
- Advanced vibration isolation systems for electric motor frequencies
- Thermal expansion accommodation for temperature gradients
- Quick-disconnect systems for maintenance accessibility
- Load monitoring and health management integration

## Core Deliverables
- `MOUNT_DESIGN.md` — Structural mount design and attachment specifications
- `VIBRATION_ISOLATION.md` — Isolation system design for electric motor harmonics
- `THERMAL_EXPANSION.md` — Thermal expansion joints and compliance mechanisms
- `QD_SYSTEMS.md` — Quick-disconnect mounting system design
- `MOUNT_MODELS.step` — 3D models of mounting systems

## Interfaces
- **54-10 Pylon Primary**, **54-20 Nacelle Structure**, **71 Powerplant**, **24 Electrical (Grounding)**  
See `../../INTERFACE_MATRIX/54↔54_71_24.csv`.

## Acceptance
- Static and dynamic load testing validates structural integrity
- Vibration testing confirms isolation effectiveness across frequency range
- Thermal cycling validates expansion accommodation
- Fatigue testing validates long-term durability
