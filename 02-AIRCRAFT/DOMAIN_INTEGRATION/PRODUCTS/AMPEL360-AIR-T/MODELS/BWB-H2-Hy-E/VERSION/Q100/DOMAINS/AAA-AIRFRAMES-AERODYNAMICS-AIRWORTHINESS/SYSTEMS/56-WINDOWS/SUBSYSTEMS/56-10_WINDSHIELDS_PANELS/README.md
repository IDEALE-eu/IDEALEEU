# 56-10 WINDSHIELDS_PANELS — Windows (BWB-H2-Hy-E, Q100)

**Purpose**: Cockpit windshields and front-facing transparent panels, including structural glazing, optical quality, bird strike resistance, and integration with heating/anti-ice systems.

## Scope
- Forward windshield panels (left and right)
- Center windshield panel (if applicable)
- Windshield structural design and mounting
- Optical quality and visibility requirements
- Bird strike and foreign object damage resistance
- Multi-layer construction (outer pane, interlayer, inner pane)
- Integration with heating elements (ATA-30 coordination)
- Mounting frames and seals

## Key Requirements
- **Structural**: Withstand pressurization, bird strike, thermal loads
- **Optical**: Meet CS-25.773 visibility requirements, minimal distortion
- **Heating**: Integrated electrical heating for anti-ice and defog
- **Damage tolerance**: Multiple pane design for redundancy
- **Mounting**: Secure attachment to fuselage structure (ATA-53)
- **Sealing**: Pressure sealing, environmental protection

## Interfaces
- **24 Electrical** — Power for heating elements, bonding/grounding
- **30 Ice/Rain Protection** — Anti-ice system coordination, control logic
- **31 Indicating/Recording** — Temperature monitoring, health status
- **53 Fuselage** — Mounting frames, structural integration
- **92 EWIS** — Wiring for heating elements and sensors

## Deliverables
- Windshield assembly drawings (CAD)
- Structural analysis (bird strike, pressure, thermal) (CAE)
- Optical analysis and verification (CAV)
- Installation procedures (CAI)
- Manufacturing specifications (CAM)
- Service and inspection procedures (CAS)
