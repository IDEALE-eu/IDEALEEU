# LOD_LOW — Low Level of Detail Assemblies

## Purpose

Low level of detail (LOD) JT files for assemblies. Optimized for fast loading and viewing of large, complex assemblies.

## What to Store

- Simplified assembly geometry
- Reduced component detail
- Lightweight representations
- Overview-level assemblies

## Usage

Use low LOD assemblies when:
- Viewing complete aircraft or major sections
- Initial overviews and navigation
- Web-based or mobile viewing
- Performance is critical
- Quick load times required

## File Characteristics

- **File size**: Smallest for assemblies (1-10 MB)
- **Component detail**: Simplified geometry
- **Load time**: Fastest
- **Use case**: Overview and navigation

## Best Practices

- Use for aircraft-level visualization
- Default for large assembly distribution
- Suitable for stakeholder presentations
- Balance simplification with recognizability
- Consider for PLM web viewer deployment
