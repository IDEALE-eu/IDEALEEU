# LOD_HIGH — High Level of Detail Assemblies

## Purpose

High level of detail (LOD) JT files for assemblies. Full-detail representation for detailed inspection and review.

## What to Store

- High-resolution assembly geometry
- Full component detail
- All features and small parts visible
- Detailed assembly representations

## Usage

Use high LOD assemblies when:
- Detailed design reviews
- Manufacturing planning
- Quality verification
- Close inspection required
- Documentation and archival
- Critical interface verification

## File Characteristics

- **File size**: Largest (20-200 MB)
- **Component detail**: Full detail
- **Load time**: Slower
- **Use case**: Detailed inspection and verification

## Best Practices

- Use for critical design reviews
- Suitable for manufacturing analysis
- May require high-performance systems
- Consider file size for distribution
- Use selectively for critical assemblies
- Combine with PMI for manufacturing reviews
