# Verification Cases

This directory stores model verification against analytical solutions and benchmarks.

## Purpose
Ensure the mathematical model is solved correctly by the solver.

## Contents
- Element verification tests
- Mesh convergence studies
- Solver verification cases
- Analytical solution comparisons
- Code-to-code comparisons
- Benchmark problems from literature

## Guidelines
- Document all verification activities
- Include acceptance criteria
- Archive test cases with results
- Update when models change
