# LOCATORS — Positioning and Location Systems

## Purpose

This directory contains components and documentation for jig locating systems that establish precise positioning reference points.

## Contents

### Subdirectories

- **[DATUM_PINS/](./DATUM_PINS/)** — Reference pins for establishing datum planes
- **[BUSHINGS/](./BUSHINGS/)** — Wear-resistant bushings for locating holes
- **[NESTS/](./NESTS/)** — Shaped locators that conform to part contours

## Locator Types

### Datum Pins
- Fixed datum pins
- Adjustable datum pins
- Diamond pins (primary locators)
- Round pins (secondary locators)

### Bushings
- Precision drill bushings
- Slip-fit bushings
- Press-fit bushings
- Renewable bushings

### Nests
- Contoured nests for complex geometries
- V-blocks for cylindrical parts
- Saddle supports
- Custom-shaped locators

## Design Requirements

All locators should:
- Provide repeatable positioning (±0.1mm)
- Be hardened and ground for wear resistance
- Include identification markings
- Document tolerance requirements
- Specify inspection methods
