# 53_TO_57 — Interfaces to ATA-57 (Wings)

## Purpose

Critical interface definitions between the 53-10 CENTER-BODY and ATA-57 Wing structures, including the wing-body integration for the Blended Wing-Body (BWB) configuration.

## Interface Scope

- Wing-body blended integration joint
- Center wing box to fuselage transition
- Load distribution and transfer
- Fuel tank interfaces and sealing
- Aerodynamic surface continuity

## Content Types

- **Wing-Body Junction ICDs** — Primary structural interface
- **Load Transfer Analysis** — FEA models and validation
- **Fuel Seal Interfaces** — Sealing system specifications
- **Aerodynamic Fairing Definitions** — OML continuity

## File Formats

- `.pdf` — ICDs and engineering reports
- `.step` — 3D interface geometry
- `.csv` — Load distribution matrices
- `.xlsx` — Seal interface specifications

## Naming Convention

## Key Interface Points

1. **Center Wing Box Integration** — Primary load-bearing structure
2. **Fuel Tank Boundaries** — Sealing and structural interfaces
3. **Wing Root Fairings** — Aerodynamic blending
4. **Wing Fold Line** (if applicable) — Articulation interface
5. **Leading Edge Integration** — OML continuity
6. **Trailing Edge Junction** — Control surface interfaces

## BWB-Specific Considerations

For Blended Wing-Body configuration:
- Continuous load path through wing-body blend
- Large-scale structural integration (no discrete wing-fuselage joint)
- Distributed load transfer across blended region
- Passenger cabin integration within wing structure

## Load Conditions

Critical load cases:
- Maximum wing bending moment
- Maximum wing torque
- Combined bending + torque
- Ground handling and jacking loads
- Fuel weight distribution scenarios

## Validation Requirements

- Global FEA model validation
- Local joint stress analysis
- Fuel seal pressure testing
- Assembly fit-check procedures
- OML surface continuity measurement

## Change Control

Wing-body interface changes are **CRITICAL** and require:
- Executive-level ECO approval via [CHANGE_CONTROL/ECO](../../CHANGE_CONTROL/ECO/README.md)
- Full structural re-analysis
- Wind tunnel validation for aerodynamic changes
- [CDR-level review](../../REVIEWS/CDR/README.md)
- Update to [INTERFACE_MATRIX](../../INTERFACE_MATRIX/README.md)
