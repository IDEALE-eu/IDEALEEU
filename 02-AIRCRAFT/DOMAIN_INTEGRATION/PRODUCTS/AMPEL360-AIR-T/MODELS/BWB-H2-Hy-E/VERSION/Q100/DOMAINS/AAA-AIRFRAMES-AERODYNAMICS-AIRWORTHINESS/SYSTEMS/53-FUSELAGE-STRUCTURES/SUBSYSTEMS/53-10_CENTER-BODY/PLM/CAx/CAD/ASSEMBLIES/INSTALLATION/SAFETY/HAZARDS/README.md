# HAZARDS — Hazard Identification and Analysis

## Purpose

This directory contains hazard identification, job hazard analyses (JHA), risk assessments, and hazard mitigation documentation for center body installation operations.

## Content Types

- **Job Hazard Analyses (JHA)** — Step-by-step hazard identification
- **Risk assessments** — Formal risk analysis documentation
- **Hazard registers** — Comprehensive hazard tracking
- **Mitigation plans** — Hazard control measures
- **Lessons learned** — Historical hazard data and improvements

## Hazard Analysis Methods

### Job Hazard Analysis (JHA)
- Break job into steps
- Identify hazards for each step
- Determine control measures
- Document findings
- Review and update regularly

### Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA)
- Early identification of hazards
- Qualitative assessment
- Identify major hazards
- Guide detailed analysis

### Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
- Identify potential failures
- Analyze effects
- Assess severity and probability
- Prioritize mitigations

## File Formats

- `.pdf` — Hazard analysis reports
- `.xlsx` / `.csv` — Hazard registers and matrices
- `.pptx` — Hazard briefing materials

## Hazard Identification

### Hazard Categories
- Physical hazards
- Chemical hazards
- Biological hazards
- Ergonomic hazards
- Psychosocial hazards
- Environmental hazards

### Identification Methods
- Workplace inspection
- Procedure review
- Historical data review
- Employee input
- Subject matter expert consultation
- Incident investigation

## Job Hazard Analysis Contents

### JHA Elements
- Task/step description
- Identified hazards
- Potential consequences
- Risk level (before controls)
- Control measures
- Residual risk (after controls)
- Responsible party
- Implementation status

### Control Measures
- Elimination of hazard
- Substitution with less hazardous
- Engineering controls
- Administrative controls
- Personal protective equipment (PPE)

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Matrix
**Severity Levels:**
- Catastrophic: Death, permanent disability, or > $1M loss
- Critical: Severe injury, temporary disability, or $100K-$1M loss
- Moderate: Minor injury, lost work time, or $10K-$100K loss
- Negligible: First aid only, no lost time, < $10K loss

**Probability Levels:**
- Frequent: Likely to occur immediately or within short period
- Probable: Will occur several times over life of system
- Occasional: Likely to occur sometime over life of system
- Remote: Unlikely but possible
- Improbable: So unlikely, can be assumed will not occur

**Risk Levels:**
- Extreme: Unacceptable, stop work
- High: Undesirable, management approval required
- Medium: Acceptable with controls
- Low: Acceptable

### Risk Acceptance
- Extreme risk: Not acceptable, must eliminate or reduce
- High risk: Management approval required with robust controls
- Medium risk: Acceptable with documented controls
- Low risk: Acceptable, continue to monitor

## Hazard Control Implementation
