# RELIABILITY

Reliability monitoring, analysis, and continuous improvement.

## Purpose

Track reliability metrics, analyze failure data, and drive maintenance program improvements through data-driven decision making.

## Contents

- **MTBF_MTTR/** - Mean Time Between Failures and Mean Time To Repair analysis
- **EVENTS/** - Reliability events, failures, and incidents
- **TRENDING/** - Statistical analysis and trending of reliability data

## Reliability Metrics

### Performance Indicators
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
- Mean Time Between Removals (MTBR)
- Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)
- Failure rate (failures per flight hour)
- Dispatch reliability

### Analysis Methods
- Weibull analysis for life prediction
- Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)
- Root cause analysis (RCA)
- Trend analysis and statistical process control

## Program Adjustments

Based on reliability data:
- Task interval optimization (escalation/de-escalation)
- New task development for emerging issues
- Task deletion for ineffective activities
- Design improvements and modifications

## Guidelines

- Collect and analyze all failure and maintenance data
- Perform root cause analysis for significant events
- Track corrective actions and effectiveness
- Report trends and recommend improvements
- Coordinate with engineering on design changes
