# DRAFT — Work-in-Progress Files

## Purpose

This directory contains **draft and work-in-progress** STEP files that are under development and not yet released for production use.

## What to Store

- Initial design exports for review
- Work-in-progress models
- Preliminary layouts
- Concept studies
- Files pending engineering approval

## Status and Usage

⚠️ **DRAFT STATUS**: Files in this directory are:
- Not approved for production use
- Subject to change without notice
- For review and evaluation only
- Not configuration-controlled

## Workflow

1. **Export draft**: Initial STEP export placed here
2. **Review**: Engineering review and validation
3. **Approval**: ECR/ECO process if needed
4. **Release**: Move to [**../RELEASED/**](../RELEASED/) when approved
5. **Archive**: Previous versions move to [**../OBSOLETE/**](../OBSOLETE/)

## File Naming

Include "DRAFT" or status indicator:
```
53-10_FRAME-F01_PN-12345_RevA_DRAFT_20250110.step
```
