# 54-20 NACELLE_STRUCTURE — Engine Containment Structure (BWB-H2-Hy-E, Q100)

**Purpose**  
Engine containment and aerodynamic fairing structure specialized for hybrid-electric nacelles with integrated cooling systems and optimized access for maintenance.

## Scope
- Structural support for electric motor cooling systems
- Maintenance access design for electric propulsion components
- Lightweight structures for distributed propulsion efficiency
- Aerodynamic integration optimized for electric propulsion airflow requirements
- Composite structures with advanced manufacturing integration

## Core Deliverables
- `STRUCTURAL_DESIGN.md` — Primary and secondary nacelle structure design
- `COOLING_INTEGRATION.md` — Electric motor cooling system structural interfaces
- `ACCESS_DESIGN.md` — Maintenance access panels and fastener systems
- `AERO_OPTIMIZATION.md` — Aerodynamic shape optimization for electric propulsion
- `NACELLE_STRUCTURE.step` — Complete nacelle structural models

## Interfaces
- **54-10 Pylon Primary**, **54-30 Mounts/Attachments**, **54-40 Cowlings/Panels**, **71 Powerplant**, **21 Air Conditioning (Cooling)**  
See `../../INTERFACE_MATRIX/54↔54_71_21.csv`.
