# 54-90 QUALIFICATION_TESTS — Complete Test Framework (BWB-H2-Hy-E, Q100)

**Purpose**  
Complete validation framework for nacelle and pylon systems with comprehensive structural, environmental, and systems testing.

## Scope
- Ultimate load testing for structural strength verification
- Fatigue testing for long-term durability validation
- Vibration testing for electric motor harmonic response validation
- Thermal cycling for thermal expansion validation
- Electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC) testing for high-power electric systems
- Hydrogen compatibility testing for material and system validation
- Fire testing for hydrogen and electrical hazard validation
- Corrosion testing for long-term environmental exposure validation

## Core Deliverables
- `STRUCTURAL_TESTS.md` — Ultimate load, fatigue, and vibration test plans and results
- `ENVIRONMENTAL_TESTS.md` — Thermal, corrosion, and environmental test plans and results
- `EMC_TESTS.md` — Electromagnetic compatibility test plans and results
- `H2_TESTS.md` — Hydrogen compatibility and fire test plans and results
- `TEST_EVIDENCE/` — Complete test data, reports, and certification evidence

## Test Categories

### Structural Testing
- Ultimate load testing validates maximum design loads
- Fatigue testing validates service life predictions
- Vibration testing validates isolation system effectiveness
- Thermal cycling validates structural response to temperature changes

### Environmental Testing
- EMI/EMC testing validates electromagnetic compatibility
- Hydrogen exposure testing validates material compatibility
- Fire testing validates fire protection system effectiveness
- Corrosion testing validates coating system durability

### Requirements Traceability
Complete traceability from requirements through test evidence:
- Requirements-to-test mapping in `TRACE/REQ2TEST.csv`
- Test coverage analysis and gap closure
- Compliance reporting for regulatory certification

## Interfaces
- **All 54 subsystems**, **71 Powerplant**, **00-PROGRAM/TESTING**  
See `../../INTERFACE_MATRIX/54↔ALL.csv`.

## Acceptance
- All tests completed per approved test plans
- Test results meet acceptance criteria
- Non-conformances resolved and closed
- Complete test evidence package for certification

## PLM/CAx
- `PLM/CAx/CAE/test_predictions.*` (Pre-test analysis and predictions)
- `PLM/CAx/CMP/test_traceability.*` (Requirements-to-test traceability)
- `PLM/EBOM_LINKS.md` (test article references)

## CM & Compliance
- Changes via ECR/ECO (CCB). Baselines: `00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/04-BASELINES/`.
- Evidence links to releases: `.../07-RELEASES/*/COMPLIANCE/`.
- Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance maintained in UTCS (METADATA/UTCS.json)
