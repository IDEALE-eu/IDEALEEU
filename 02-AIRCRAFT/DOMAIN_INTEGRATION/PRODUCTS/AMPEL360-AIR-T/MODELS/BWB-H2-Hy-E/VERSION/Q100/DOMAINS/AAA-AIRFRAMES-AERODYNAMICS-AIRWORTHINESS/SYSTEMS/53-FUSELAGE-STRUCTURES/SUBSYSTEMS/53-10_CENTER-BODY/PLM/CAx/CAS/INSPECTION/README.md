# INSPECTION

Inspection methods and procedures for structural integrity verification.

## Purpose

Document inspection techniques, procedures, and acceptance criteria for detecting and evaluating structural damage or degradation.

## Contents

- **NDT/** - Non-destructive testing methods (eddy current, ultrasonic, etc.)
- **BOROSCOPE/** - Boroscope inspection procedures and access points
- **LEAK_CHECKS/** - Pressure and leak testing procedures

## Inspection Methods

### Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)
- Eddy current inspection
- Ultrasonic testing
- Radiographic inspection
- Magnetic particle inspection
- Dye penetrant inspection

### Visual Inspection
- General visual inspection (GVI)
- Detailed visual inspection (DVI)  
- Special detailed inspection (SDI)
- Boroscope inspection

### Operational Tests
- Leak checks
- Pressure tests
- Functional tests

## Guidelines

- Follow approved NDT procedures
- Document inspection intervals and areas
- Define acceptance criteria and rejection limits
- Include sample images of typical findings
- Reference structural repair manual for defect evaluation
