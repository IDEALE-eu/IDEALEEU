# 54-40 COWLINGS_PANELS — Removable Access Systems (BWB-H2-Hy-E, Q100)

**Purpose**  
Removable access panels and aerodynamic cowlings optimized for maintenance accessibility of hybrid-electric propulsion components.

## Scope
- Aerodynamic cowling design and optimization
- Quick-access panel systems for electric propulsion maintenance
- Fastener and locking systems for rapid access
- Sealing systems for environmental protection
- Integration with cooling air management

## Core Deliverables
- `COWLING_DESIGN.md` — Aerodynamic cowling shape and structure
- `ACCESS_PANELS.md` — Panel layout and access philosophy
- `FASTENER_SYSTEMS.md` — Quick-access fastener and locking systems
- `SEALING_DESIGN.md` — Environmental seals and gaskets
- `PANEL_MODELS.step` — 3D models of panels and cowlings

## Interfaces
- **54-20 Nacelle Structure**, **54-50 Inlets/Outlets**, **71 Powerplant**, **05 Time Limits (Maintenance)**  
See `../../INTERFACE_MATRIX/54↔54_71_05.csv`.

## Acceptance
- Aerodynamic testing confirms drag and noise targets
- Access time studies validate maintenance efficiency
- Environmental testing validates sealing effectiveness
- Durability testing confirms fastener system life
