- Instrumentation performance checks
- Test conditions within limits
- Safety compliance verification
- Anomaly documentation

**Log**: `CHECKS/InProcess_Log_[TEST_ID].xlsx`

### Post-Test Checks

**Test Completion Review**:
- Data completeness check
- Data quality assessment
- Procedure completion verification
- Test article condition documented
- Anomalies resolved or documented
- Data archived properly

**Checklist**: `CHECKS/PostTest_Checklist_[TEST_ID].pdf`

### Data Quality Checks

**Data QA Review**:
- Calibration records current
- Data within expected ranges
- No data dropouts or corruption
- Metadata complete
- Traceability established
- Backup verified

**Report**: `CHECKS/DataQA_Report_[TEST_ID].pdf`

### Documentation Review

**Document QA**:
- Reports complete per template
- Figures and tables correct
- References accurate
- Approval signatures present
- Revision control proper
- Archive location recorded

**Checklist**: `CHECKS/DocumentQA_Checklist_[REPORT_ID].pdf`

## Quality Audits

### Internal Audits

**Scope**: Verify compliance with internal procedures and quality management system

**Frequency**: Quarterly or before major milestones

**Process**:
1. Audit planning and notification
2. Document review
3. Process observation
4. Interviews with personnel
5. Finding documentation
6. Corrective action planning
7. Follow-up verification
8. Audit report

**Report**: `AUDITS/Internal_Audit_[DATE].pdf`

### External Audits

**Types**:
- **Customer Audits**: Contract compliance verification
- **Certification Authority Audits**: Compliance with certification requirements
- **Supplier Audits**: Supplier quality verification (if applicable)

**Process**:
1. Audit notification
2. Preparation (document gathering, dry run)
3. Opening meeting
4. Audit execution
5. Finding review
6. Closing meeting
7. Corrective action plan
8. Finding closure verification

**Report**: `AUDITS/External_Audit_[AUTHORITY]_[DATE].pdf`

### Audit Findings

**Finding Classification**:
- **Major**: Significant non-compliance, immediate action required
- **Minor**: Lesser non-compliance, corrective action needed
- **Observation**: Improvement opportunity, no formal corrective action

**Tracking**:
- Finding number
- Classification
- Description
- Assigned to
- Corrective action
- Due date
- Status
- Verification

**Database**: `AUDITS/Findings_Tracker.xlsx`

## Quality Metrics

Track and report:
- **Defect Rate**: Defects per test or per unit
- **Test Escapes**: Issues found after testing
- **Audit Findings**: Number and severity of findings
- **Corrective Action Closure**: On-time closure rate
- **Data Quality**: Percentage of data meeting quality standards
- **Procedure Compliance**: Deviations from procedures

**Dashboard**: `QA_Metrics_Dashboard.xlsx`

## Quality Standards

Validation program complies with:
- **ISO 9001**: Quality management systems
- **AS9100**: Aerospace quality management
- **Company QMS**: Internal quality procedures
- **ARP4754A**: Development assurance for aviation
- **DO-178C/DO-254**: Software/hardware development (if applicable)

## Continuous Improvement

Quality system includes:
- Lessons learned capture
- Process improvement initiatives
- Best practice sharing
- Training and competency development
- Root cause analysis and prevention

## QA Independence

Quality assurance maintains independence:
- QA personnel independent of test execution team
- Direct reporting to Quality Manager
- Authority to stop tests for quality/safety issues
- Independent review of test results
