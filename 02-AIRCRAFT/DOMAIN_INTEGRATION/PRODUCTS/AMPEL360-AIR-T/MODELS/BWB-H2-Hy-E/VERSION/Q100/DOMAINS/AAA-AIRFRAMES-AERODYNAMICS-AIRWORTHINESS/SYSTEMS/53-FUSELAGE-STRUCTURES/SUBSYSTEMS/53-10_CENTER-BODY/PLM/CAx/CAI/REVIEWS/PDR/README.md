# PDR — Preliminary Design Review

## Purpose

Preliminary Design Review (PDR) artifacts documenting the integration design maturity and readiness to proceed to detailed design for the CENTER-BODY subsystem.

## Content Types

- **PDR Presentation Materials** — Review briefing slides
- **Design Documentation** — Preliminary design descriptions
- **Interface Definitions** — Initial interface specifications
- **Risk Assessments** — Identified risks and mitigation plans
- **Action Item Lists** — PDR findings and closure tracking

## File Formats

- `.pdf` — Presentation slides and reports
- `.pptx` — Editable presentation files
- `.xlsx` — Action item tracking and matrices

## PDR Objectives

PDR validates:
- Integration concept is feasible
- Key interfaces are defined
- Major risks are identified
- Requirements are allocated
- Design approach is sound

## PDR Review Scope

Integration aspects reviewed:
- Overall integration architecture
- Interface definitions (all systems)
- Mounting and attachment concepts
- Routing strategies (EWIS, hydraulics, etc.)
- Access and maintenance provisions
- Tolerance and clearance approaches

## PDR Exit Criteria

To pass PDR:
- [ ] Integration architecture approved
- [ ] All critical interfaces identified
- [ ] Major risks have mitigation plans
- [ ] Requirements traceability established
- [ ] Design schedule is credible
- [ ] All RIDs (Review Item Discrepancies) dispositioned

## PDR Deliverables Checklist

- [ ] Integration architecture description
- [ ] Interface matrix (preliminary)
- [ ] Key interface ICDs (draft)
- [ ] Master geometry definition
- [ ] Risk register
- [ ] Design schedule
- [ ] Resource plan

## Action Item Tracking

PDR action items tracked until closure:
- Unique ID assignment
- Description and source
- Assigned owner
- Due date
- Status (Open/Closed)
- Verification method
- Closure evidence

## Change Control

PDR baseline established:
- Formal configuration baseline (PDR Baseline)
- Changes after PDR require ECO approval
- Design maturity: ~30-40%
- Cost estimate confidence: ±30%
