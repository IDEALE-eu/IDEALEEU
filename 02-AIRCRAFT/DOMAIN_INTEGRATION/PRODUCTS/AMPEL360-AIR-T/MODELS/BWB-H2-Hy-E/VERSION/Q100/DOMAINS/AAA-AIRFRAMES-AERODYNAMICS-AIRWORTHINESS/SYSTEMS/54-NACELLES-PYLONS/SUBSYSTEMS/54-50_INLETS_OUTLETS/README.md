# 54-50 INLETS_OUTLETS — Airflow Management Systems (BWB-H2-Hy-E, Q100)

**Purpose**  
Air intake and exhaust flow management systems optimized for electric propulsion airflow requirements and integrated thermal management.

## Scope
- Fan duct design optimized for electric fan motors
- Dedicated cooling air inlets for electric motor thermal management
- Hot air exhaust systems for electric motor cooling
- Boundary layer control for BWB integration
- Inlet distortion management for distributed propulsion

## Core Deliverables
- `INLET_DESIGN.md` — Air intake design and optimization
- `COOLING_INLETS.md` — Electric motor cooling air inlet systems
- `EXHAUST_SYSTEMS.md` — Hot air exhaust design and routing
- `BL_CONTROL.md` — Boundary layer management strategies
- `FLOW_MODELS.step` — 3D models of inlet/outlet systems

## Interfaces
- **54-20 Nacelle Structure**, **54-40 Cowlings/Panels**, **71 Powerplant**, **21 Air Conditioning (Cooling)**  
See `../../INTERFACE_MATRIX/54↔54_71_21.csv`.
