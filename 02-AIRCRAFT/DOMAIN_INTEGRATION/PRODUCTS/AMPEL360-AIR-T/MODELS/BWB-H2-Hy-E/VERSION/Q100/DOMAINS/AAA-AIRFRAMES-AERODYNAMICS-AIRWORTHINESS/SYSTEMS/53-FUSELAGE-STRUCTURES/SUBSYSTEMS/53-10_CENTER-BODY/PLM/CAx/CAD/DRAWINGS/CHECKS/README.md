- [ ] Ready for approval

### Engineering Approval
**Purpose**: Final review and approval by engineering management

**Checklist Items**:
- [ ] Design meets requirements
- [ ] Technical content correct
- [ ] Checker review complete
- [ ] All issues resolved
- [ ] Configuration management ready
- [ ] Authorized for release

## Detailed Check Procedures

### Dimensional Completeness Check
1. Verify all features dimensioned
2. Check dimension from proper datums
3. Confirm no over-dimensioning
4. Verify no missing dimensions
5. Check dimension units consistent
6. Verify dimension precision appropriate

### Tolerance Check
1. General tolerance block present
2. Specific tolerances where required
3. Tolerances achievable by manufacturing
4. Critical dimensions identified
5. Tolerance stack-up acceptable
6. Fit requirements met

### GD&T Check
1. Datums defined properly (A, B, C hierarchy)
2. Datum features appropriate for function
3. GD&T symbols applied correctly
4. Feature control frames complete
5. Material condition modifiers correct
6. Tolerance values appropriate
7. GD&T consistent with function

### Material Specification Check
1. Material fully specified (grade, form, condition)
2. Material appropriate for application
3. Heat treatment specified if required
4. Material available and approved
5. Material finish/coating specified
6. Special processes noted

### Drawing-Model Consistency Check
1. Drawing dimensions match model
2. Geometry consistent with model
3. Features match model features
4. Modifications noted and approved
5. Model revision matches drawing
6. Export/derivation correct

### BOM Check (Assemblies)
1. All components listed in BOM
2. Item numbers match balloons
3. Part numbers correct
4. Quantities correct
5. Descriptions accurate
6. Materials specified (if applicable)
7. BOM matches assembly model

## Quality Standards

### Drawing Quality Criteria
**Excellent**:
- No errors or omissions
- Exceeds standard requirements
- Manufacturing-friendly
- Clear and unambiguous

**Good**:
- Meets all requirements
- Minor clarifications may be helpful
- Manufacturability verified
- Ready for release

**Needs Work**:
- Missing information
- Unclear or ambiguous
- Manufacturing concerns
- Requires revision

**Unacceptable**:
- Major errors or omissions
- Does not meet standards
- Not manufacturable as shown
- Significant rework required

### Pass/Fail Criteria
**Pass**: Ready for next stage or release
**Conditional Pass**: Minor issues to be corrected, re-check not required
**Fail**: Significant issues, must be revised and re-checked

## Best Practices

### Check Process
- Allow adequate time for checks
- Don't rush quality checks
- Use checklists systematically
- Document all checks
- Track issues to closure
- Learn from issues found

### Checker Independence
- Checker should be independent of designer
- Fresh eyes catch more issues
- Technical expertise required
- Objectivity important
- Constructive feedback

### Issue Resolution
- Address all identified issues
- Document resolution approach
- Verify corrections effective
- Close loop on all issues
- Learn from repeated issues

### Continuous Improvement
- Review check effectiveness
- Update checklists based on experience
- Share lessons learned
- Improve processes
- Reduce recurring issues

## Check Timing

### During Development
- Frequent self-checks during creation
- Informal peer reviews at milestones
- Catch issues early

### Before Review
- Complete self-check before submitting
- Allow time for corrections
- Submit only quality work

### Formal Review
- Scheduled checker review
- Allow adequate review time
- Provide supporting information
- Be responsive to questions

### Before Release
- Final approval check
- Verify all issues resolved
- Configuration management ready
- Quality release gate
