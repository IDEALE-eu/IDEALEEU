# CAS â€” Computer-Aided Simulation & Maintenance Support

## Purpose

Computer-Aided Simulation for maintenance planning, support engineering, and operational readiness of the center body structure (ATA-53-10).

## Structure

This directory integrates maintenance engineering with simulation capabilities:

### Maintenance Program Structure

- **[MAINTENANCE_PROGRAM/](MAINTENANCE_PROGRAM/)** - MSG-3 analysis, ALS items, and zonal programs
- **[TASKS/](TASKS/)** - Scheduled, unscheduled, and troubleshooting procedures
- **[ACCESS/](ACCESS/)** - Access panels, tool clearances, and maintainability studies
- **[INSPECTION/](INSPECTION/)** - NDT, boroscope, and leak check procedures
- **[REPAIR/](REPAIR/)** - SRM procedures, structural and composite repairs
- **[WORK_CARDS/](WORK_CARDS/)** - Job cards and maintenance checklists
- **[TOOLS_EQUIPMENT/](TOOLS_EQUIPMENT/)** - GSE and special tooling requirements
- **[SPARES/](SPARES/)** - LRU provisioning and maintenance kits
- **[RELIABILITY/](RELIABILITY/)** - MTBF/MTTR tracking, events, and trending
- **[COMPLIANCE/](COMPLIANCE/)** - Airworthiness directives and regulatory records
- **[DATA/](DATA/)** - Maintenance logs and standardized forms
- **[TEMPLATES/](TEMPLATES/)** - Standard documentation templates
- **[SCRIPTS/](SCRIPTS/)** - Automation and analysis tools

## What to Store

### Simulation Models
- Maintenance simulation models
- Accessibility analysis models  
- Tool clearance simulations
- Repair process simulations
- Training simulations

### Maintenance Engineering
- Task development analysis
- Maintainability studies
- Human factors analysis
- Time and motion studies
- Cost-benefit analysis

### Support Data
- Technical illustrations
- Interactive electronic technical manuals (IETM) sources
- 3D visualization models
- AR/VR maintenance training content

## Guidelines

- Commit large binary files via Git LFS
- Provide README.md for each simulation model with inputs/outputs/tools/versions
- Link simulation results to maintenance task definitions
- Coordinate with CAD, CAE for design and analysis integration
- Reference maintenance program data from [01-FLEET/MRO_STRATEGY/03-MAINTENANCE_PROGRAM/](../../../../../../../../../../01-FLEET/MRO_STRATEGY/03-MAINTENANCE_PROGRAM/)

## Integration Points

- **[CAD](../CAD/)**: Design models for access and tooling analysis
- **[CAE](../CAE/)/[FEA](../CAE/FEA/)**: Structural analysis for repair substantiation
- **[CAM](../CAM/)**: Manufacturing data for repair procedures
- **[PLM](../../)/[EBOM](../../EBOM_LINKS.md)**: Parts provisioning and spares management
