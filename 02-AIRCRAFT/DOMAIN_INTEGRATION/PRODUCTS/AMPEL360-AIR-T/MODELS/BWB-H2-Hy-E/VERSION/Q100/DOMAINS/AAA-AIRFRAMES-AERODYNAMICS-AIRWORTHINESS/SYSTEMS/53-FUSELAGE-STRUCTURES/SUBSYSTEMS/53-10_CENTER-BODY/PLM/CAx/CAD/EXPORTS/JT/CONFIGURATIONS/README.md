# CONFIGURATIONS — Configuration Variants

## Purpose

This directory contains JT files for different configuration variants of the center body assembly. These represent alternative arrangements, simplifications, or optimizations for specific purposes.

## What to Store

- Configuration variants
- Design alternatives
- Simplified models
- Lightweight representations
- Review-specific configurations

## Subdirectories

- [`SIMPLIFIED/`](./SIMPLIFIED/) — Simplified geometry configurations
- [`LIGHTWEIGHT/`](./LIGHTWEIGHT/) — Performance-optimized configurations
- [`REVIEW/`](./REVIEW/) — Design review packages

## Configuration Types

### Simplified
Geometry simplified for specific analysis or review purposes while maintaining essential characteristics.

### Lightweight
Optimized for performance with reduced file size and complexity for fast loading.

### Review
Purpose-built configurations for design reviews, with appropriate detail and annotations.

## Usage

Use configurations for:
- Different stakeholder needs
- Performance optimization
- Specific review purposes
- Analysis simplifications
- Progressive detail disclosure
