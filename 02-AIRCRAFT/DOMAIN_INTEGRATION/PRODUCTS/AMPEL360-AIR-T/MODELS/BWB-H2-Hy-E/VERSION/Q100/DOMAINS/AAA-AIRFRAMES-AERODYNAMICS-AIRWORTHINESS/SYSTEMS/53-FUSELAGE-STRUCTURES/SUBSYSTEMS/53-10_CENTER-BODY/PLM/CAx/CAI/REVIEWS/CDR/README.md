# CDR — Critical Design Review

## Purpose

Critical Design Review (CDR) artifacts demonstrating the integration design is complete, validated, and ready for manufacturing for the CENTER-BODY subsystem.

## Content Types

- **CDR Presentation Materials** — Comprehensive review briefings
- **Final Design Documentation** — Complete integration specifications
- **Verification Evidence** — Analysis results, test data
- **Manufacturing Readiness** — Production planning documentation
- **Action Item Closure** — PDR action item verification

## File Formats

- `.pdf` — Final presentations and reports
- `.pptx` — Presentation files
- `.xlsx` — Verification matrices and tracking

## Naming Convention

## CDR Objectives

CDR validates:
- Design is complete and released
- All interfaces are closed and verified
- Manufacturing can proceed
- Verification complete or planned
- Cost and schedule are firm

## CDR Review Scope

Comprehensive review of:
- Final integration design (100% complete)
- All interface ICDs (signed and approved)
- Structural analyses (complete with margin)
- Tolerance stack-ups (validated)
- Manufacturing processes (defined and qualified)
- Assembly sequences (validated)
- Test and verification plans (ready to execute)

## CDR Exit Criteria

To pass CDR:
- [ ] Design 100% complete and released
- [ ] All interfaces closed and verified
- [ ] Structural analysis complete (MS ≥ 0)
- [ ] Manufacturing processes qualified
- [ ] Tooling design complete
- [ ] Verification plans approved
- [ ] All PDR actions closed
- [ ] All CDR RIDs dispositioned

## CDR Deliverables Checklist

- [ ] Complete design drawings (released)
- [ ] All ICDs (signed by both parties)
- [ ] Structural analysis reports (approved)
- [ ] Tolerance stack-up analyses (validated)
- [ ] Manufacturing process specifications
- [ ] Assembly procedures
- [ ] Test plans and procedures
- [ ] Quality assurance plans

## Verification Matrix

All requirements verified by:
- **Analysis**: Structural, thermal, etc.
- **Test**: Ground test, flight test
- **Inspection**: Dimensional, visual
- **Demonstration**: Functional verification

## Change Control

CDR baseline is formal:
- Configuration baseline (CDR Baseline)
- All changes require Class I ECO
- Design maturity: 100%
- Cost estimate confidence: ±10%
