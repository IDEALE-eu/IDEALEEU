# REVISIONS — Revision Management for Sub-Assemblies

## Purpose

This directory manages revision states and history for 53-10 Center Body sub-assemblies. It provides organized storage for assemblies in different lifecycle states: draft (work-in-progress), released (approved for production), and obsolete (superseded or retired).

## Organization

### DRAFT/
Work-in-progress assemblies not yet released:
- **Concept designs**: Initial design studies
- **Design iterations**: Multiple design options
- **Work in progress**: Incomplete assemblies
- **Review versions**: Pre-release reviews
- **Test configurations**: Experimental setups

### RELEASED/
Approved assemblies for production:
- **Production releases**: Current production design
- **Certified designs**: Type-certified configurations
- **Baseline configurations**: Configuration baselines
- **Approved variations**: Released design options
- **Archived releases**: Historical production versions

### OBSOLETE/
Superseded or retired assemblies:
- **Superseded designs**: Replaced by newer versions
- **Retired configurations**: No longer in production
- **Failed concepts**: Designs not pursued
- **Historical archive**: Reference for legacy parts
- **Lessons learned**: Design iterations for future reference

## Revision Numbering

### Standard Revision Scheme
- **Draft versions**: D01, D02, D03... (pre-release)
- **Released versions**: R01, R02, R03... (production)
- **Engineering changes**: R01A, R01B... (minor changes)
- **Major revisions**: R01, R02... (significant changes)

### Alternative Schemes
- **Alphabetic**: A, B, C... (simple progression)
- **Numeric**: 001, 002, 003... (numeric sequence)
- **Semantic**: v1.0.0, v1.1.0, v2.0.0 (major.minor.patch)

## Naming Convention

Include revision in filename:
```
53-10_ASM_<assembly>_<revision>_<date>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_ASM_FRAME-F05_D01_20240115.CATProduct` (draft)
- `53-10_ASM_FRAME-F05_R01_20240215.CATProduct` (released)
- `53-10_ASM_FRAME-F05_R01_20230101.CATProduct` (obsolete - superseded by R02)

## Revision History

Maintain revision history document for each assembly:

| Revision | Date | Author | Description | Approval |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| D01 | 2024-01-15 | J. Smith | Initial draft | - |
| D02 | 2024-01-20 | J. Smith | Added doublers | - |
| R01 | 2024-02-15 | J. Smith | Released for production | A. Johnson |
| R02 | 2024-05-10 | J. Smith | Added reinforcement at F05 | A. Johnson |

## Release Process

### From Draft to Released
1. **Design complete**: Design meets requirements
2. **Internal review**: Engineering review complete
3. **Analysis complete**: Stress analysis validated
4. **Drawing complete**: Engineering drawings issued
5. **BOM verified**: Bill of materials accurate
6. **Approval**: Design authority approval
7. **Release**: Move from DRAFT/ to RELEASED/
8. **Notification**: Notify stakeholders of release

### From Released to Obsolete
1. **Superseded**: New revision released
2. **Retired**: No longer in production
3. **Archive**: Move from RELEASED/ to OBSOLETE/
4. **Retention**: Maintain for historical reference
5. **Notification**: Update affected documents

## Configuration Control

### Engineering Change Orders (ECO)
- **ECO initiation**: Request for change
- **Impact analysis**: Assess change effects
- **Approval**: Obtain necessary approvals
- **Implementation**: Incorporate change
- **Effectivity**: Define when change applies
- **Notification**: Inform affected parties

### Effectivity Management
- **Serial number effectivity**: Applies to specific S/N range
- **Date effectivity**: Applies after specific date
- **Mod status**: Modification or retrofit applicability
- **Configuration options**: Optional configurations

## Version Control

### Git Integration
- Tag releases in Git: `v1.0-R01`, `v2.0-R02`
- Branch for major revisions
- Commit messages reference ECO or change reason
- Pull requests for review before release
- Protect released branches from modification

### File Metadata
Embed revision information in files:
- **Part properties**: Revision, date, author
- **File attributes**: Custom properties in CAD files
- **Watermarks**: Draft or Released watermark on drawings
- **Status flags**: Digital revision indicators

## Related Directories

- **All sub-assembly directories**: Revisions apply to all assemblies
- **Frame sections**: [`../FRAME_SECTIONS/`](../FRAME_SECTIONS/)
- **Stringer bays**: [`../STRINGER_BAYS/`](../STRINGER_BAYS/)
- **Documentation**: [`../DOCS/`](../DOCS/)
- **Templates**: [`../TEMPLATES/`](../TEMPLATES/) - Standard revision practices

## Lifecycle States

### Draft State
- **Editable**: Can be modified freely
- **Not released**: Not for production use
- **Review status**: In review or awaiting approval
- **Temporary**: May be deleted if not pursued

### Released State
- **Read-only**: Cannot be modified (new revision required)
- **Production approved**: Approved for manufacturing
- **Configuration controlled**: Changes require ECO
- **Permanent**: Must be retained per records retention policy

### Obsolete State
- **Historical**: For reference only
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer version
- **No longer used**: Not for production
- **Archived**: Maintained for historical record

## Document Control

### Required Documentation
For each released assembly:
- **Engineering drawings**: Manufacturing drawings
- **BOM**: Bill of materials
- **Specifications**: Design and material specs
- **Analysis reports**: Stress analysis, testing
- **Approval signatures**: Authorized approvals
- **Revision history**: Change log

### Record Retention
- **Released designs**: Retain indefinitely
- **Draft designs**: Retain per company policy (1-5 years typical)
- **Obsolete designs**: Retain per records retention policy
- **Supporting documents**: Retain with design files

## Audit Trail

Maintain audit trail of:
- **Who**: Changed or released the assembly
- **What**: What was changed
- **When**: Date and time of change
- **Why**: Reason for change (ECO reference)
- **How**: Method of change implementation

## Quality Management

### Traceability
- Link revisions to requirements
- Track changes through lifecycle
- Document compliance with standards
- Maintain certification records

### Verification
- Verify released assemblies meet requirements
- Validate design changes
- Confirm proper approval before release
- Check for unintended consequences

## Metadata Requirements

Each revision should document:
- **Revision level**: Current revision identifier
- **Release date**: Date of release (if released)
- **Status**: Draft, Released, or Obsolete
- **Author**: Responsible engineer
- **Approver**: Design authority who approved
- **ECO reference**: Associated change order (if applicable)
- **Effectivity**: Where and when applicable
- **Reason for change**: Summary of changes made

## Migration Between States

### Draft → Released
- Complete all review and approval steps
- Move files from DRAFT/ to RELEASED/
- Update status in PLM/PDM system
- Notify manufacturing and supply chain
- Archive draft versions for reference

### Released → Obsolete
- New revision released as superseding design
- Move old revision from RELEASED/ to OBSOLETE/
- Update status in PLM/PDM system
- Notify affected parties
- Maintain for historical reference and spares support

### Released → Released (new revision)
- Create ECO for proposed change
- Develop new revision in DRAFT/
- Complete approval process
- Release new revision to RELEASED/
- Move old revision to OBSOLETE/
