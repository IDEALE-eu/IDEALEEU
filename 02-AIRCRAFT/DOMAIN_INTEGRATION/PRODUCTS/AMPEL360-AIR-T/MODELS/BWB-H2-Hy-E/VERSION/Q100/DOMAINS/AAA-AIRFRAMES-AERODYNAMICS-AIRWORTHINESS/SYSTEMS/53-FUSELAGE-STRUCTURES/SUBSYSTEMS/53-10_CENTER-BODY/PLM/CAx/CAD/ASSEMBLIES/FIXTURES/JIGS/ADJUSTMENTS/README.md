# ADJUSTMENTS — Adjustment and Alignment Systems

## Purpose

This directory contains components and systems for fine adjustment and alignment of jig components and workpieces.

## Contents

### Subdirectories

- **[SHIMS/](./SHIMS/)** — Precision shim specifications and requirements
- **[SCREWS/](./SCREWS/)** — Adjustment screws and fine-positioning devices
- **[JACKS/](./JACKS/)** — Leveling jacks and support jacks

## Adjustment Types

### Shims
- Thickness specifications (common: 0.1mm, 0.2mm, 0.5mm, 1.0mm)
- Material specifications (steel, aluminum, brass)
- Shim locations and quantities
- Shim packages and combinations

### Adjustment Screws
- Fine-positioning screws (0.01mm resolution)
- Locking mechanisms
- Graduated dials
- Micrometer adjustments

### Leveling Jacks
- Screw jacks (manual adjustment)
- Hydraulic jacks (heavy loads)
- Anti-vibration mounts
- Load capacity specifications

## Usage

Adjustments are used for:
- Initial jig setup and leveling
- Compensation for part tolerances
- Wear compensation over time
- Temperature compensation
- Fine positioning of components

## Documentation

Each adjustment system should specify:
- Adjustment range
- Resolution/increment
- Locking method
- Inspection method
- Calibration requirements
