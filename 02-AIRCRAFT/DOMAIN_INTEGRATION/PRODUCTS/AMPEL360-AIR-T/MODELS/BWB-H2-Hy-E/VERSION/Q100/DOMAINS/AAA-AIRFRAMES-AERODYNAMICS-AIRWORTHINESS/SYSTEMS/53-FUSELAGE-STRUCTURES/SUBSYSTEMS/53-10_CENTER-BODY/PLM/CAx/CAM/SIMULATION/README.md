# SIMULATION — Manufacturing Simulation

## Purpose
Simulation and validation of manufacturing processes including machine simulation and collision detection.

## Contents
- **[MACHINE_SIM/](MACHINE_SIM/)** — CNC machine simulation
- **[CLASH_CHECK/](CLASH_CHECK/)** — Collision detection and clearance verification

## Related Directories
- **[../NC_PROGRAMS/](../NC_PROGRAMS/)** — NC programs being simulated
- **[../VERIFICATION/](../VERIFICATION/)** — Post-simulation verification
- **[../DATA/MACHINE_DB/](../DATA/MACHINE_DB/)** — Machine models and specifications

## Guidelines
- Simulate before production
- Document collision clearances
- Verify tool reach and accessibility
- Include cycle time analysis

## Formats
- Simulation files (Vericut, NCSimul, etc.)
- Simulation reports (PDF, video)
