# JIGS — Assembly Jigs and Positioning Fixtures

## Purpose

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for assembly jigs and positioning fixtures used in the fabrication and assembly of the 53-10 Center Body. It includes CAD models, engineering drawings, procedures, maintenance records, quality documentation, and all supporting information needed for jig design, fabrication, operation, and lifecycle management.

## Directory Organization

The JIGS directory is organized into functional categories covering the complete lifecycle of jig tooling from design through operation, maintenance, and retirement. Each subdirectory contains specific documentation and data related to its function, with cross-references to related directories.

3. Quality checks (QA/CHECKS/)
4. Issue tracking (RUN_DATA/ISSUES/)
5. Periodic reporting (REPORTS/PERIODIC/)

### Maintenance Phase
1. Scheduled maintenance (MAINTENANCE/SCHEDULE/)
2. Service documentation (MAINTENANCE/RECORDS/)
3. Calibration intervals (CALIBRATION/)
4. Spare parts management (MAINTENANCE/SPARES/)
5. Continuous improvement

### Revision Phase

4. Re-validation and approval
5. Implementation and documentation

### Retirement Phase
1. End-of-life assessment
2. Final documentation
3. Archive to REVISIONS/OBSOLETE/
4. Disposition (storage, scrapping, etc.)
