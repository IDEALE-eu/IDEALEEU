# BULKHEADS â€” Pressure and Structural Bulkhead Parts

## Purpose

This directory contains CAD part files for bulkheads used in the 53-10 Center Body subsystem. Bulkheads are transverse structural panels that separate compartments, resist pressure loads, and transfer major structural loads.

## Component Description

### Bulkhead Types
- **Pressure bulkheads**: Resist cabin pressurization loads
- **Structural bulkheads**: Transfer concentrated loads (landing gear, wings)
- **Fire bulkheads**: Provide fire barrier between compartments
- **Tank bulkheads**: Form boundaries of fuel or hydrogen tanks
- **Partial bulkheads**: Segment-specific load transfer elements

### Configuration
- **Flat**: Planar bulkheads with stiffening
- **Domed**: Spherical or elliptical for efficient pressure resistance
- **Corrugated**: Alternating corrugations for stiffness

## Naming Convention

Examples:
- `53-10_BULKHEAD_BH-01_FWD-PRESSURE_v01.CATPart`
- `53-10_BULKHEAD_BH-05_WING-ATTACHMENT_v02.prt`
- `53-10_BULKHEAD_BH-10_AFT-PRESSURE_v01.sldprt`

## Design Considerations

### Structural Requirements
- Resist cabin pressure differential (typically 8-9 psi)
- Transfer landing gear or wing loads to fuselage structure
- Provide fire barrier per certification requirements
- Support system equipment and installations
- Accommodate structural pass-throughs and access doors

### Material Specifications
- **Aluminum sheet**: 2024-T3 with stiffeners
- **Thick sections**: 7075-T6 for high-load areas
- **Composite**: Carbon fiber for weight-critical applications
- **Titanium**: For high-temperature fire barriers
