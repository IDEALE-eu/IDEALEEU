# COMPLIANCE — Regulatory Compliance Evidence

## Purpose

This directory organizes compliance evidence demonstrating that the 53-10 CENTER-BODY subsystem meets all applicable certification requirements and program specifications.

## Directory Structure

### CS_FAR_25/
Compliance evidence for CS-25 (EASA) / FAR Part 25 (FAA) certification requirements.

**Key Requirements for Center Body**:

- **CS-25.305** — Strength and deformation
  - Ultimate load demonstration (1.5× limit)
  - Limit load deflection within acceptable limits
  - Compliance by test: Static strength tests

- **CS-25.337** — Limit maneuvering load factors
  - Design load cases for BWB configuration
  - Compliance by analysis with test validation

- **CS-25.365** — Pressurization loads
  - 8.6 psi cabin differential pressure
  - Compliance by test: Pressurization tests

- **CS-25.571** — Damage tolerance and fatigue
  - Fatigue life demonstration (design service goal)
  - Damage growth and residual strength
  - Compliance by test: Fatigue and damage tolerance tests

- **CS-25.581** — Lightning protection
  - Lightning strike zone protection
  - Composite material lightning protection
  - Compliance by test: Lightning strike tests

- **CS-25.613** — Material strength properties
  - Material property substantiation
  - Environmental effects (temperature, moisture)
  - Compliance by test: Material qualification tests

- **CS-25.783** — Fuselage doors
  - Access panel and door structural requirements
  - Compliance by test and analysis

- **CS-25.855/856** — Cargo and baggage compartments (fire)
  - Fire resistance and burnthrough
  - Compliance by test: Fire tests

### DO160/
Compliance evidence for DO-160 environmental testing (if applicable to installed equipment or for environmental qualification).

**Applicable Sections**:
- Section 5: Temperature and altitude
- Section 7: Humidity
- Section 8: Vibration
- Section 10: Shock
- Section 18: Induced signal susceptibility (if electrical systems)
- Section 23: Lightning induced transient susceptibility

### PROGRAM_REQS/
Compliance evidence for program-specific requirements including H₂ integration and BWB-specific requirements.

**H₂ Integration Requirements**:
- ISO 19880-8: Hydrogen safety
- Cryogenic compatibility (-253°C)
- Tank mounting and load transfer
- Thermal protection and insulation

**BWB-Specific Requirements**:
- Blended fuselage-wing structural continuity
- Load paths for distributed propulsion
- Pressurization of non-cylindrical structure
- H₂ tank integration in center body

## Compliance Matrix

Maintain a compliance matrix tracking:
- Requirement ID
- Requirement text
- Compliance method (test, analysis, similarity, inspection)
- Evidence location (test report, analysis report, etc.)
- Compliance status (complete, in-work, planned)
- Certification authority finding (if issued)

**File**: `COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.xlsx` in each subdirectory

## Compliance Evidence Package

For each requirement, compile:

1. **Requirement Statement** — Full text of requirement
2. **Applicability Assessment** — Why requirement applies to center body
3. **Compliance Method** — How compliance will be shown
4. **Evidence References** — Pointers to test reports, analyses
5. **Compliance Statement** — Declaration of compliance
6. **Certification Finding** — Authority acceptance (when issued)

## Compliance Review Process

1. **Requirements Allocation** — Assign requirements to center body
2. **Compliance Planning** — Define compliance methods
3. **Evidence Generation** — Execute tests, analyses
4. **Compliance Review** — Internal review of evidence
5. **Certification Submission** — Submit to authority
6. **Authority Review** — Address findings and questions
7. **Finding Closure** — Close certification findings

## Certification Milestones

- **Type Inspection Authorization (TIA)** — Authority approval to start testing
- **Interim Findings** — Preliminary review comments
- **Type Certificate (TC)** — Final certification approval
