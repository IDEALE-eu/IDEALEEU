notes: |
  MOD-M1 is a comprehensive upgrade package designed for operators seeking
  premium cabin experience and advanced avionics capabilities. Can be
  installed during production or retrofitted to existing aircraft.
  
  Particularly attractive for operators on premium routes or those
  requiring advanced navigation and predictive maintenance capabilities.
  
  Weight penalty of 85 kg results in 10 nm range reduction but improved
  operational efficiency can offset this through optimized routing.
