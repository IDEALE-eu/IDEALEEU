# INTERFACE_GROUPS â€” Interface Assembly Groups

## Purpose

This directory contains sub-assembly models for major interface regions where the 53-10 Center Body connects to adjacent primary structure. These interfaces are critical for load transfer, structural continuity, and system integration.

## Organization

Interface groups are organized by connection region:
- **WING_INTERFACE/**: Wing-to-body joint assemblies
- **NOSE_INTERFACE/**: Forward section connection assemblies
- **AFT_INTERFACE/**: Aft section connection assemblies

## Interface Group Contents

### WING_INTERFACE
Wing-body joint assemblies including:
- Wing spar attachment fittings
- Carry-through structure
- Load transfer fittings
- Wing box closure panels
- Fuel system interfaces
- Systems routing through wing-body joint

### NOSE_INTERFACE
Forward section connection assemblies including:
- Forward bulkhead interface
- Cockpit structure attachment
- Nose landing gear integration
- Forward pressure bulkhead
- Avionics bay interfaces
- Radome attachment provisions

### AFT_INTERFACE
Aft section connection assemblies including:
- Aft bulkhead interface
- Empennage attachment points
- APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) bay structure
- Aft pressure bulkhead
- Tail cone transition structure
- Aft body systems interfaces

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern for interface assemblies:
```
53-10_ASM_INTERFACE_<location>_<detail>_v<version>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_ASM_INTERFACE_WING-LEFT_v01.CATProduct`
- `53-10_ASM_INTERFACE_NOSE-FWD_v02.asm`
- `53-10_ASM_INTERFACE_AFT-EMPENNAGE_v01.sldasm`

## Design Considerations

### Structural Continuity
- Ensure proper load path continuity
- Design for ultimate and fatigue loads
- Include fail-safe and damage tolerance provisions
- Validate stress concentration at interfaces
- Design for manufacturing tolerances

### Interface Control
- Define interface control points (ICPs)
- Document mating surfaces and tolerances
- Specify assembly sequence and procedures
- Include alignment and adjustment provisions
- Define interface responsibility (which part controls)

### Systems Integration
- Plan for cable and duct routing
- Include hydraulic and pneumatic line routing
- Provide for fuel system connections (wing interface)
- Design for maintenance access
- Include systems separation and protection

## Load Transfer

### Wing-Body Joint Loads
- **Vertical loads**: Lift forces from wings
- **Lateral loads**: Maneuvering and gust loads
- **Torsional loads**: Wing twist and fuselage torsion
- **Thermal loads**: Differential thermal expansion
- **Fatigue loads**: Cyclic loading over aircraft life

### Forward/Aft Interface Loads
- **Bending moments**: Fuselage bending
- **Shear forces**: Vertical and lateral shear
- **Torsion**: Fuselage torsional loads
- **Pressure loads**: Cabin pressurization effects
- **Landing gear loads**: Ground loads and reactions (forward)

## Interface Documentation

Each interface assembly should include:
- **Interface Control Document (ICD)**: Formal interface definition
- **Interface loads**: Load cases and magnitudes
- **Mating dimensions**: Critical dimensions and tolerances
- **Assembly procedure**: Step-by-step installation
- **Inspection criteria**: Quality checks and acceptance
- **Test requirements**: Interface validation tests

## Validation Requirements

Before finalizing interface assemblies:
- [ ] Interface loads validated by stress analysis
- [ ] Mating dimensions checked against ICDs
- [ ] Interference check with adjacent systems
- [ ] Assembly sequence validated with tooling
- [ ] Maintenance access verified
- [ ] Systems routing feasibility confirmed
- [ ] Manufacturing tolerances achievable
- [ ] Test articles built and tested (if required)

## Manufacturing and Assembly

### Fabrication Considerations
- Design for large fitting machining
- Plan for heat treatment and finishing
- Consider material procurement lead times
- Design for dimensional inspection
- Include assembly alignment features

### Installation Planning
- Define installation sequence
- Plan for temporary support fixtures
- Include alignment and shimming provisions
- Document torque requirements
- Plan for final inspection and acceptance

## Metadata Requirements

Each interface assembly should include:
- **Part number**: Following 53-10 numbering system
- **Description**: Interface location and type
- **ICD reference**: Associated Interface Control Document
- **Mate parts**: Adjacent structure part numbers
- **Load rating**: Maximum design loads
- **Material**: Primary materials and treatments
- **Mass properties**: Weight and CG
- **Status**: Design state (draft, released, obsolete)

## Quality and Certification

### Critical Characteristics
- Hole locations and sizes for fasteners
- Mating surface flatness and finish
- Load path alignment
- Fastener torque values
- Dimensional tolerances at interfaces

### Inspection Requirements
- First Article Inspection (FAI)

## Version Control

- Use Git LFS for large assembly files (> 10 MB)
- Tag interface design reviews
- Document load or configuration changes
- Maintain revision history for each interface
- Track ICD changes and revisions
- Coordinate changes with adjacent system owners
