# QUALITY — Quality Control Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains quality control documentation for the 53-10 Center Body assembly operations, including checkpoints and checksheets.

## Contents

### Subdirectories
- **[CHECKPOINTS/](CHECKPOINTS/)** — Quality checkpoint definitions
- **[CHECKSHEETS/](CHECKSHEETS/)** — Quality inspection checksheets

### Documentation Types
- Quality control plans
- Inspection criteria
- Acceptance standards
- Non-conformance procedures

## Quality Control Strategy

### Purpose
- Ensure assembly quality
- Verify conformance to specifications
- Document inspection results
- Enable traceability
- Support continuous improvement

### Approach
- In-process inspection
- Critical checkpoints
- First article inspection
- Periodic verification
- Final acceptance

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern:
```
53-10_QUALITY_<document-type>_<operation-id>_<version>.<ext>
```
