# WINDOW_BAYS â€” Window Bay Sub-Assemblies

## Purpose

This directory contains sub-assembly models for window bay structures of the 53-10 Center Body. Window bays are reinforced structural regions that accommodate window installations while maintaining structural integrity around cutouts.

## Window Types

### Cockpit Windows
- **Windshield panels**: Forward-facing flight crew windows
- **Side windows**: Pilot and co-pilot side visibility
- **Overhead windows**: Optional overhead visibility panels

### Cabin Windows
- **Passenger windows**: Standard cabin windows (typically 12" x 16")
- **Emergency exit windows**: Larger windows for emergency egress
- **Door vision panels**: Small windows in passenger doors

## Window Bay Components

A typical window bay assembly includes:
- **Window frame**: Structural frame around window opening
- **Reinforced skin**: Doublers and reinforcements around cutout
- **Frame reinforcements**: Beefed-up fuselage frames at window row
- **Stringer doublers**: Reinforced stringers adjacent to windows
- **Window stop**: Retaining lip for window installation
- **Seal grooves**: Machined or bonded seal interfaces
- **Attachment provisions**: Fasteners or retention system

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern for window bay assemblies:
```
53-10_ASM_WINDOW-BAY_<type>-<location>_v<version>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_ASM_WINDOW-BAY_CABIN-ROW-03_v01.CATProduct`
- `53-10_ASM_WINDOW-BAY_EMERGENCY-EXIT_v02.asm`
- `53-10_ASM_WINDOW-BAY_COCKPIT-WINDSHIELD_v01.sldasm`

## Design Considerations

### Structural Design
- Design for loads around cutout (stress concentration)
- Maintain adequate load paths around opening
- Include fail-safe and crack arrest features
- Design for pressurization loads (8.5 psi typical)
- Validate fatigue life at window corners

### Window Installation
- Define window retention method (mechanically fastened or bonded)
- Specify seal mating surfaces and tolerances
- Include drainage provisions
- Design for window replacement access
- Provide for inspection of seals and retention

### Load Paths
- **Circumferential loads**: Pressure hoop loads around opening
- **Longitudinal loads**: Fuselage tension/compression transfer
- **Pressure loads**: Cabin pressure on window and surround
- **Bird strike loads**: High-velocity impact (cockpit windows)
- **Thermal loads**: Temperature cycling and gradients

## Window Spacing

Typical cabin window spacing:
- **Window pitch**: 20-24 inches (frame station spacing)
- **Vertical location**: Passenger eye level (seated)
- **Cutout size**: 12" x 16" typical for cabin windows
- **Edge distance**: Minimum 2.5D from fastener to cutout edge

## Integration Points

Window bays interface with:
- **Frame sections**: Reinforced frames at window stations
- **Skin panel modules**: Window cutouts in skin panels
- **Stringer bays**: Stringer doublers at window rows
- **Interior monuments**: Window shade and trim installations
- **Insulation**: Acoustic and thermal blankets around windows

## Pressure and Sealing

For pressurized cabin windows:
- Design for cabin pressure differential (8.5 psi typical)
- Include primary and secondary seals
- Design drainage for seal grooves
- Validate sealing under all flight conditions
- Plan for pressure testing during assembly

## Design Guidelines

### Cutout Reinforcement
- Add doublers to skin around window opening
- Reinforce frames at window row
- Add doublers to stringers adjacent to windows
- Include crack stopper features at corners
- Design for damage tolerance

### Seal Design
- Machine or bond seal grooves
- Design for proper seal compression
- Include drainage for moisture removal
- Provide for seal replacement
- Validate sealing under thermal cycling

### Window Retention
- **Mechanically fastened**: Bolted or riveted retention ring
- **Bonded installation**: Adhesive bonded to frame
- **Hybrid**: Mechanical retention with adhesive seal
- Design for window removal without structure damage

## Cockpit Window Considerations

Special requirements for flight crew windows:
- **Bird strike resistance**: Per FAR 25.631 and 25.775
- **Optical quality**: Distortion-free visibility
- **Heating provisions**: Electric or bleed air defogging/anti-ice
- **Wiper provisions**: Windshield wiper mounting (if applicable)
- **Protective coatings**: Scratch-resistant and hydrophobic coatings

## Cabin Window Requirements

Passenger cabin windows:
- **Impact resistance**: Protection from passenger contact
- **Thermal insulation**: Reduce heat transfer and condensation
- **Acoustic damping**: Noise reduction
- **Scratch resistance**: Durable inner surface
- **UV protection**: Reduce UV transmission to cabin

## Metadata Requirements

Each window bay assembly should include:
- **Part number**: Following 53-10 numbering system
- **Description**: Window type and location
- **Window dimensions**: Height x width of opening
- **Frame station**: Fuselage station of window
- **Stringer position**: Stringer row location
- **Pressure rating**: Design pressure differential
- **Material**: Primary materials and treatments
- **Mass properties**: Weight and CG
- **Status**: Design state (draft, released, obsolete)

## Certification Requirements

### Structural Testing
- Static strength test to ultimate load
- Fatigue test for design life
- Pressure test for leak integrity
- Bird strike test (cockpit windows)
- Thermal cycling test

### Optical Testing
For cockpit windows:
- Optical quality and distortion limits
- Light transmission requirements
- Scratch and abrasion resistance
- Chemical resistance to cleaning agents

## Manufacturing Considerations

### Fabrication Planning
- Precision drilling for window fasteners
- Surface finish requirements for seal grooves
- Complex forming for doublers around cutout
- Tight tolerances for optical windows
- Material selection for bird strike resistance

### Assembly Integration
- Install window from exterior after structure assembly
- Coordinate with interior trim installations
- Plan for seal installation and curing
- Include provisions for alignment and shimming
- Document final leak and optical checks

## Quality Assurance

Critical quality checks:
- Window opening dimensions and tolerances
- Seal groove depth and finish
- Fastener hole locations and perpendicularity
- Reinforcement continuity around cutout
- Leak test at design pressure
- Optical quality (cockpit windows)

## Maintenance Considerations

Design for maintainability:
- Window replacement without structure removal
- Seal inspection access
- Drainage cleaning provisions
- Fastener torque check access
- Damage inspection accessibility

## Version Control

- Use Git LFS for large assembly files (> 10 MB)
- Tag design reviews and certification tests
- Document window location or size changes
- Maintain revision history for each window bay
- Coordinate changes with cabin interior design
