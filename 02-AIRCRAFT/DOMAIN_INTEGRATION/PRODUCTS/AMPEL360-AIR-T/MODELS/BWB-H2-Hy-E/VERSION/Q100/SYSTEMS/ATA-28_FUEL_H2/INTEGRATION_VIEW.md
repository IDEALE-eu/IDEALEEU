# ATA-28 FUEL (H₂) — Integration View

## Functional Overview
Hydrogen fuel storage, conditioning, and distribution system. Cryogenic storage with pressure and temperature management for hybrid-electric propulsion.

## Key Dependencies
- **ATA-21**: Thermal conditioning and heat exchange
- **ATA-24**: Electrical power for pumps, valves, sensors
- **ATA-26**: Fire/leak detection and suppression
- **ATA-36**: Inerting and purging systems
- **ATA-42**: IMA health monitoring and fuel management
- **ATA-92**: EWIS for sensors and control

## Operating Modes
- Ground: Fueling, conditioning, safety checks
- Takeoff: Maximum H₂ flow to fuel cells
- Cruise: Steady-state H₂ consumption
- Descent: Reduced flow, thermal management
- Emergency: Purge and vent procedures

## Safety Considerations
- Leak detection and isolation
- Temperature and pressure monitoring
- Boil-off management
- Emergency venting

## Integration Points
See INTERFACE_MATRIX for detailed cross-system interfaces.
