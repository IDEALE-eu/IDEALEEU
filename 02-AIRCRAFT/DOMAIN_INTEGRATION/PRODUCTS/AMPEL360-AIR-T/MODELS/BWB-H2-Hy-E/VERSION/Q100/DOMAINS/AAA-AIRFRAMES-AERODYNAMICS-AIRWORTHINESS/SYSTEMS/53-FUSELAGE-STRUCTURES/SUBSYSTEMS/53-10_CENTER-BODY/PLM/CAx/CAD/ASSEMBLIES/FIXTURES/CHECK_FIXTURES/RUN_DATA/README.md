# RUN_DATA — Inspection Run Data

## Purpose

This directory contains measurement data and logs from inspection operations using check fixtures.

## Contents

### Subdirectories
- **[MEASUREMENTS/](./MEASUREMENTS/)** — Raw and processed measurement data
- **[LOGS/](./LOGS/)** — Inspection operation logs

## Data Types

### Measurement Data
- CMM measurement files
- Laser tracker point clouds
- Gauge readings
- Visual inspection results
- Statistical process control (SPC) data

### Log Data
- Inspection start/end times
- Operator information
- Equipment used
- Environmental conditions
- Issues and resolutions

## Data Management

### Data Collection
- Automated from CMM/laser tracker
- Manual entry for gauge measurements
- Real-time capture when possible
- Timestamped and traceable
- Linked to part serial number

### Data Storage
- Raw data preserved
- Processed results archived
- Organized by date and part
- Backed up regularly
- Accessible for analysis

### Data Retention
