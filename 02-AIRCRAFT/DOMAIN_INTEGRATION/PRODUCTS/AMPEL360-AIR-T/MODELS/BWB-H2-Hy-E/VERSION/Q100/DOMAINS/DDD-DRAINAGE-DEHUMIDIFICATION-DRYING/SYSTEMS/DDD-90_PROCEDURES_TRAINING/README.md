# SYSTEM: DDD-90_PROCEDURES_TRAINING

**Architecture:** BWB-H2-Hy-E â€¢ **Domain:** DDD-DRAINAGE-DEHUMIDIFICATION-DRYING

## Purpose

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), training materials, and Computer-Based Training (CBT) modules for all DDD domain systems.

## Quick Links

- **Sub-Systems:** `SUBSYSTEMS/*/`

## Subsystem Breakdown

| Subsystem | ID | Description |
|-----------|----|----|
| SOPs Checklists | 90-01 | Standard operating procedures and checklists |
| CBT Training Modules | 90-02 | Computer-based training modules and materials |

## UiX Workflow

1. Develop SOPs for all DDD systems
2. Create training materials and CBT modules
3. Implement artifacts in `SUBSYSTEMS/*/`

> PLM & CAx **inside each subsystem** only

## Compliance

- **ICDs:** see `00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/09-INTERFACES/`
- **Baselines & Changes:** `00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/04-BASELINES/`

## Notes

This system contains procedural and training documentation for the entire DDD domain, covering:
- Surface protection and drainage procedures
- Dehumidification system operation
- Ice/rain protection operations
- Water ballast operations (if applicable)
