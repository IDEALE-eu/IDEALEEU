# ISSUES — Issue Tracking and Resolution

## Purpose

This directory manages issues, non-conformances, and failures identified during validation testing of the 53-10 CENTER-BODY subsystem, ensuring systematic tracking and resolution.

## Directory Structure

### NCR/
Non-Conformance Reports for deviations from requirements, specifications, or procedures.

**Triggers for NCR**:
- Test results outside specification limits
- Procedure deviations during test execution
- Manufacturing defects discovered during testing
- Documentation errors or omissions
- Equipment calibration failures

**NCR Process**:
1. Identification and documentation
2. Impact assessment
3. Disposition (use-as-is, rework, repair, scrap)
4. Root cause analysis (if required)
5. Corrective action (if required)
6. Verification of corrective action
7. Closure

### FRACAS/
Failure Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Action System for tracking failures and implementing improvements.

**FRACAS Workflow**:
1. **Failure Reporting** — Document failure occurrence
2. **Failure Analysis** — Investigate root cause
3. **Corrective Action** — Implement fix
4. **Verification** — Verify effectiveness of corrective action
5. **Closure** — Document and close

**Failure Categories**:
- Design deficiency
- Manufacturing defect
- Test procedure error
- Equipment failure
- Human error
- Unknown/under investigation

## NCR Documentation

Each NCR includes:

1. **NCR Number**: Format `NCR-53-10-[YEAR]-[SEQ]`
2. **Title**: Brief description of non-conformance
3. **Date Identified**: When discovered
4. **Identified By**: Person who discovered NCR
5. **Description**: Detailed description of non-conformance
6. **Impact**: Assessment of impact on design, test, certification
7. **Disposition**: 
   - **Use-as-is**: Accept non-conformance without correction
   - **Rework**: Return to standard configuration
   - **Repair**: Fix to acceptable (but non-standard) configuration
   - **Scrap**: Reject and replace
8. **Root Cause**: Analysis of why non-conformance occurred
9. **Corrective Action**: Actions to prevent recurrence
10. **Verification**: How corrective action effectiveness verified
11. **Approval Chain**: MRB (Material Review Board) approval
12. **Closure**: Sign-off when complete

## FRACAS Documentation

Each FRACAS report includes:

1. **FRACAS Number**: Format `FRACAS-53-10-[YEAR]-[SEQ]`
2. **Failure Description**: What failed and how
3. **Failure Date/Time**: When failure occurred
4. **Test Conditions**: Conditions at time of failure
5. **Failure Mode**: How component/system failed
6. **Failure Mechanism**: Physical process causing failure
7. **Root Cause**: Underlying reason for failure
8. **Failure Effect**: Impact on system/test
9. **Severity Classification**: Critical/major/minor
10. **Corrective Action**: Design changes, procedure updates, etc.
11. **Verification**: Re-test or analysis to verify fix
12. **Lessons Learned**: Documentation for future programs

## Severity Classification

### Critical
- Loss of structural integrity
- Safety hazard
- Certification requirement not met
- Program schedule impact >30 days

### Major
- Significant performance degradation
- Rework required
- Schedule impact 7-30 days

### Minor
- Minor deviation from specification
- No rework required
- Schedule impact <7 days

## Material Review Board (MRB)

For significant NCRs, convene MRB:
- **Members**: Chief Engineer, Test Lead, Quality Manager, Certification Manager
- **Charter**: Review NCR, approve disposition, ensure corrective action
- **Meeting**: Within 48 hours for critical NCRs

## Metrics and Reporting

Track and report:
- **NCR Rate**: Number of NCRs per test campaign
- **Open NCRs**: Number of open NCRs by age
- **Disposition Distribution**: Use-as-is vs. rework vs. repair vs. scrap
- **Root Cause Distribution**: Design vs. manufacturing vs. test vs. etc.
- **Corrective Action Effectiveness**: Recurrence rate

**Reporting Frequency**: Monthly summary to program management

## Corrective Action Verification

All corrective actions must be verified:
- **Design Changes**: Re-analysis and/or re-test
- **Process Changes**: Process audit and verification
- **Procedure Changes**: Procedure review and training
- **Training**: Competency assessment

## Closure Criteria

NCR/FRACAS closed when:
- Root cause identified (or documented as unknown)
- Disposition approved by MRB
- Corrective action implemented
- Verification complete
- Documentation complete
- Lessons learned captured

## Database

Maintain issue database:
- All NCRs and FRACAS reports
- Status tracking
- Trend analysis
- Searchable by keywords, dates, severity

**File**: `ISSUE_DATABASE.xlsx`
