# CAO - Computer-Aided Optimization

[â†‘ Up to 10-03_SAFETY_PERMITS_ESD_ATEX](../../../README.md)

Computer-Aided Optimization artifacts for safety permits and hazardous area classifications.

## Purpose

Design optimization studies, parametric analyses, and performance trade-offs supporting the development, verification, and deployment of safety permits and hazardous area classifications.

## Structure

- **VARIABLES/** - Design variables and parameters
- **OBJECTIVES/** - Optimization objectives and constraints
- **CONSTRAINTS/** - Design constraints and limits
- **SOLVERS/** - Optimization solver configurations
- **RUNS/** - Optimization run data and logs
- **RESULTS/** - Pareto frontiers and optimal solutions
- **REPORTS/** - Optimization study reports

## Key Artifacts

- Design of experiments (DOE) matrices
- Pareto frontier plots
- Optimization convergence histories
- Trade study reports
- Sensitivity analysis results

## Naming Convention

```

```

## Standards

- Follow applicable CAO standards and best practices
- Ensure traceability to EBOM items
- Maintain configuration control per CM plan
- Document assumptions and validation basis
- Include metadata and revision history

## File Formats

- **Config:** Optimization setup files (.json, .xml)
- **Results:** CSV, Excel spreadsheets
- **Reports:** PDF/A for documentation
- **Data:** HDF5 for large datasets

## Traceability

All CAO artifacts must:
- Link to EBOM items in [PLM/EBOM_LINKS.md](../EBOM_LINKS.md)
- Reference requirements and specifications
- Include verification and validation evidence
- Maintain audit trail of changes
- Support configuration management
