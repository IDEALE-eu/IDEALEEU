# PLANS — Assembly Sequence Plans

## Purpose

This directory contains high-level assembly sequence plans that define the overall strategy and approach for assembling the 53-10 Center Body.

## Contents

### Plan Types
- **Master assembly plans**: Overall assembly sequence strategy
- **Build sequence plans**: Major assembly phase definitions
- **Integration plans**: System integration sequence
- **Milestone plans**: Key assembly checkpoints

## Plan Elements

### Strategic Planning
- Assembly philosophy and approach
- Major build phases
- Critical path identification
- Resource requirements
- Schedule dependencies

### Build Strategy
- Parallel vs. sequential operations
- Subassembly strategies
- Tooling and fixture requirements
- Facility and equipment needs
- Personnel skill requirements

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern:
```
53-10_PLAN_<plan-type>_<version>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_PLAN_MASTER-ASSEMBLY_v01.pdf`
- `53-10_PLAN_BUILD-SEQUENCE_v02.pdf`
- `53-10_PLAN_INTEGRATION_v01.pdf`

## Plan Development

### Process Steps
1. Analyze assembly design and requirements
2. Identify critical build sequences
3. Define major assembly phases
4. Establish resource requirements
5. Validate with stakeholders
6. Review and approve
7. Release for detailed planning
