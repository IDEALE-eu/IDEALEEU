# SEQUENCE — Operation Sequence Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains detailed documentation of the operational sequence for using jigs in assembly processes.

## Contents

### Subdirectories

- **[STEPS/](./STEPS/)** — Detailed step-by-step operation sequences
- **[CHECKPOINTS/](./CHECKPOINTS/)** — Verification checkpoints and hold points

## Sequence Documentation

### Operation Steps
- Numbered sequential operations
- Time estimates for each step
- Required personnel and skills
- Tool and equipment requirements
- Part orientation and handling
- Measurement and verification

### Sequence Types
- Setup sequence
- Assembly operation sequence
- Inspection sequence
- Teardown/changeover sequence

## Checkpoints

### Verification Points
- Pre-operation checks
- In-process verification
- Post-operation verification
- Final acceptance checks

### Documentation Requirements
Each checkpoint should specify:
- What to verify
- Acceptance criteria
- Measurement method
- Recording requirements
- Action if out of spec

## Visual Documentation

Include:
- Process flow diagrams
- Operation photographs
- CAD model sequences
- Annotated drawings
