## Venting System Types

### Pressurization Vents
- **Cabin pressure relief valves** — Overpressure protection
- **Outflow valves** — Normal cabin pressure control
- **Emergency pressure dump** — Rapid depressurization capability

### Equipment Venting
- **Avionics bay vents** — Equipment cooling airflow
- **Battery compartment vents** — Gas release paths
- **Equipment drain vents** — Condensation removal

### Tank Venting
- **Fuel tank vents** — Pressure equalization
- **H2 tank vents** — Boil-off gas venting (critical)
- **Hydraulic reservoir vents** — Fluid expansion accommodation

### Environmental Venting
- **Bilge drains** — Water removal from structure
- **Lavatory vents** — Waste system venting
- **Galley vents** — Cooking fume exhaust

## Design Requirements

### General Venting Principles
- All vents terminate overboard
- No cross-contamination between systems
- Flame arrestors where flammable gases present
- Back-flow prevention where required
- Ice protection provisions for high-altitude vents

### Vent Line Sizing
Minimum vent line diameters:
- **Cabin pressurization**: Per cabin volume calculations
- **Equipment bays**: 25mm minimum
- **Battery compartments**: 50mm minimum
- **Fuel tank vents**: Per tank volume and altitude
- **H2 tank vents**: Per boil-off rate + safety factor

### Routing Requirements
- Continuous downward slope: Minimum 1° toward drain
- No low points (liquid traps)
- Support spacing: Maximum 600mm
- Protection from freezing
- Drainage of condensation

## Drain Mast Locations

Overboard drain requirements:
- **Location**: Outside aerodynamic surfaces
- **Orientation**: Aft-facing to prevent ram air
- **Diameter**: Sufficient for maximum flow
- **Ice protection**: Heating or location selection
- **Marking**: "DRAIN - DO NOT PLUG"

## Pressure Differential Management

Critical pressure differentials:
| Location | Normal ΔP | Maximum ΔP | Relief Method |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Cabin | 0.56 bar (8.2 psi) | 0.62 bar (9.0 psi) | Relief valve |
| Equipment bay | 0-0.07 bar | 0.14 bar | Vent |
| Battery compartment | Slight negative | 0.03 bar | Vent |
| Fuel tanks | ±0.03 bar | ±0.07 bar | Vent/surge tank |

## Flame Arrestor Requirements

Flame arrestors required for:
- Fuel tank vents
- H2 tank vents (critical)
- Battery compartment vents (if explosive gases)
- Any vent from flammable fluid systems

Flame arrestor specifications:
- Per SAE AS406 or equivalent
- Verified non-blocking under icing conditions
- Inspection interval per system criticality

## H2 System Venting (Critical)

Hydrogen venting requires special provisions:
- **Vent location**: High point, away from ignition sources
- **Vent orientation**: Vertical upward preferred
- **Separation**: >3m from any ignition source
- **Flow capacity**: 2× maximum boil-off rate
- **Flame arrestor**: Required per safety standards
- **Leak detection**: H2 sensors near vent paths

## Validation Requirements

- Flow rate testing (all operating conditions)
- Pressure differential verification
- Condensation drain functionality testing
- Ice protection system validation
- Flame arrestor flow testing
- Emergency depressurization timing tests

## Installation Requirements

1. **Line routing verification** — Check path and slope
2. **Support installation** — Secure at required intervals
3. **Drain mast installation** — Seal to prevent water ingress
4. **Flame arrestor installation** — Correct orientation
5. **Functional testing** — Verify flow and drainage
6. **Leak testing** — Pressurize and check for leaks
7. **Documentation** — Record as-built configuration

## Change Control

Venting system changes require:
- Systems engineering review
- ECO via [CHANGE_CONTROL/ECO](../../CHANGE_CONTROL/ECO/README.md)
- Flow analysis re-validation
- Pressure testing after modification
- Update to system documentation

## Safety Critical

H2 venting is **SAFETY CRITICAL**:
- All changes require detailed safety review
- Hydrogen detection system integration
- Emergency procedures documentation
- Inspector sign-off required for all installations
