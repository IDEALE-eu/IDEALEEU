# CTR — Center Zone

## Purpose
DXF files for center zone components and assemblies.

## Contents
- Center section frames and ribs
- Center skin panels
- Main structural elements
- Center fittings and brackets
- Interface drawings with forward and aft zones

## Zone Boundaries
**Center zone extends**:
- From forward zone interface
- To aft zone interface
- Includes main structural section

## Structural Components
Typical parts in center zone:
- Main frames (primary structure)
- Skin panels and doublers
- Wing/payload attach points (if applicable)
- Main structural bulkheads
- Main landing gear support (if applicable)
- Fuel tank structure (if applicable)
- Major systems support structure

## File Naming
```
53-10_CTR_<component>_<type>_<revision>_<date>.dxf
```

Examples:
- `53-10_CTR_FRAME-F05_PROFILE_A_20250110.dxf`
- `53-10_CTR_SKIN-SP10_FLAT_B_20250110.dxf`
- `53-10_CTR_BULKHEAD-BH05_ASSEMBLY_A_20250110.dxf`

## Interface Requirements
Document interfaces with:
- **Forward zone**: Structural attachments and load paths
- **Aft zone**: Structural attachments and load paths
- **Wings/Payload**: Major attach points and load transfer
- **Landing gear**: Main gear attachments
- **Systems**: Fuel, hydraulics, environmental

## Critical Features
Center zone typically includes:
- Highest structural loads
- Wing carry-through structure
- Fuel containment (if applicable)
- Landing gear attachment
- Major systems interfaces
- Pressure vessel boundaries

## Manufacturing Considerations
- Large assembly fixtures required
- Critical alignment requirements
- Load-bearing joint quality
- Systems integration complexity
- Inspection access planning
- Maintainability access
