# 41-WATER_BALLAST — Integration View

**Status:** TEMPLATE - Apply if applicable to aircraft configuration

## System Overview

Provides water ballast capability for weight and balance adjustment during flight testing or operational configurations requiring variable ballast, with comprehensive tank protection and drainage management.

## Functional Description

The 41-WATER_BALLAST system encompasses (if implemented):

- **Ballast Tanks**: Structural tanks with corrosion protection for water storage
- **Fill and Drain Systems**: Valves, pumps, and piping for ballast control
- **Level Sensing**: Accurate water level measurement for weight management
- **Venting and Protection**: Tank venting and drain path protection systems

## Operational Modes

1. **Normal Flight**: Ballast quantity maintained per flight plan
2. **Ballast Adjustment**: Active fill or drain operations
3. **Maintenance Mode**: System drainage and inspection
4. **Emergency Dump**: Rapid ballast discharge if required

## Functional Requirements

- Provide ballast capacity of [TBD] kg
- Enable fill/drain rates of [TBD] kg/min
- Measure ballast quantity with ±[TBD]% accuracy
- Ensure tank structural integrity and corrosion resistance
- Provide emergency dump capability

## Budgets & Constraints

- **Mass**: Empty tank system mass [TBD] kg
- **Ballast Capacity**: Maximum water ballast [TBD] kg
- **Power**: Pump power consumption [TBD] kW
- **Structural**: Tank load bearing capability

## Verification Approach

- Structural load testing of tanks
- Fill and drain system flow verification
- Level sensing accuracy validation
- Corrosion protection testing
- Emergency dump capability verification
- System integration testing

## Implementation Notes

**TEMPLATE SYSTEM**: This system structure is provided as a template. Implement only if water ballast is part of the aircraft configuration requirements. If not applicable, subsystems can remain as placeholders or be removed per program requirements.
