## Purpose

JT files that have been superseded by newer versions or retired from use. Maintained for historical reference and traceability.

## What to Store

- Superseded revisions
- Retired designs
- Historical versions
- Replaced configurations
- End-of-life models

## Characteristics

- **Status**: Obsolete, superseded
- **Approval**: No longer authorized for new use
- **Use**: Reference and historical record only
- **Change control**: Read-only, no further changes
- **Distribution**: Restricted, historical access only

## Usage

Use obsolete files for:
- Design history
- As-built documentation (legacy hardware)
- Lessons learned analysis
- Design evolution tracking
- Compliance and audit trail
- Legacy support and maintenance
