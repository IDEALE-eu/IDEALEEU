# CAO — Computer-Aided Optimization

## Purpose
Structural optimization workflows for the center body (53-10) of the BWB-H2-Hy-E aircraft, including topology, sizing, and shape optimization studies.

## Directory Structure

### Core Optimization Components
- **[PROBLEMS/](PROBLEMS/)** — Optimization problem definitions and formulations
- **[VARIABLES/](VARIABLES/)** — Design variables (geometry, layup, gauges, fasteners)
- **[CONSTRAINTS/](CONSTRAINTS/)** — Design constraints (strength, buckling, pressurization, CG, access, clearances)
- **[OBJECTIVES/](OBJECTIVES/)** — Optimization objectives (mass, stiffness, cost)
- **[METHODS/](METHODS/)** — Optimization methods (topology, size, shape)
- **[SOLVERS/](SOLVERS/)** — Classical and quantum-assisted optimization solvers

### Workflow Management
- **[COUPLING/](COUPLING/)** — CAD/CAE integration and model links
- **[RUNS/](RUNS/)** — Optimization studies and execution logs
- **[RESULTS/](RESULTS/)** — Pareto fronts, plots, and reports
- **[CONFIG/](CONFIG/)** — Configuration files and random seeds
- **[SCRIPTS/](SCRIPTS/)** — Pre-processing, post-processing, and driver scripts

### Supporting Data
- **[DATA/](DATA/)** — Materials and loads databases
- **[QA/](QA/)** — Reproducibility validation and quality checks
- **[TEMPLATES/](TEMPLATES/)** — Reusable templates and examples

## Optimization Workflow
1. Define problem ([PROBLEMS/](PROBLEMS/))
2. Configure design variables ([VARIABLES/](VARIABLES/)) and constraints ([CONSTRAINTS/](CONSTRAINTS/))
3. Select optimization method ([METHODS/](METHODS/)) and solver ([SOLVERS/](SOLVERS/))
4. Set up CAD/CAE coupling ([COUPLING/](COUPLING/))
5. Execute optimization runs ([RUNS/](RUNS/))
6. Analyze results ([RESULTS/](RESULTS/))
7. Validate and document ([QA/](QA/), [RESULTS/REPORTS/](RESULTS/))
