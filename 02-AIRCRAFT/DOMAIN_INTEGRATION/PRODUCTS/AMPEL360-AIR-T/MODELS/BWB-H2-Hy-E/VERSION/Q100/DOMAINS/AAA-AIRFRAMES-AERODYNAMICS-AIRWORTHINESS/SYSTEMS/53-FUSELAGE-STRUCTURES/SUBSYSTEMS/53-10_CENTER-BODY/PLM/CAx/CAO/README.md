# CAO — Computer-Aided Optimization

## Purpose
Structural optimization workflows for the center body (53-10) of the BWB-H2-Hy-E aircraft, including topology, sizing, and shape optimization studies.

## Directory Structure

### Core Optimization Components
- **PROBLEMS/** — Optimization problem definitions and formulations
- **VARIABLES/** — Design variables (geometry, layup, gauges, fasteners)
- **CONSTRAINTS/** — Design constraints (strength, buckling, pressurization, CG, access, clearances)
- **OBJECTIVES/** — Optimization objectives (mass, stiffness, cost)
- **METHODS/** — Optimization methods (topology, size, shape)
- **SOLVERS/** — Classical and quantum-assisted optimization solvers

### Workflow Management
- **COUPLING/** — CAD/CAE integration and model links
- **RUNS/** — Optimization studies and execution logs
- **RESULTS/** — Pareto fronts, plots, and reports
- **CONFIG/** — Configuration files and random seeds
- **SCRIPTS/** — Pre-processing, post-processing, and driver scripts

### Supporting Data
- **DATA/** — Materials and loads databases
- **QA/** — Reproducibility validation and quality checks
- **TEMPLATES/** — Reusable templates and examples

## Optimization Workflow
1. Define problem (PROBLEMS/)
2. Configure design variables (VARIABLES/) and constraints (CONSTRAINTS/)
3. Select optimization method (METHODS/) and solver (SOLVERS/)
4. Set up CAD/CAE coupling (COUPLING/)
5. Execute optimization runs (RUNS/)
6. Analyze results (RESULTS/)
7. Validate and document (QA/, REPORTS/)
