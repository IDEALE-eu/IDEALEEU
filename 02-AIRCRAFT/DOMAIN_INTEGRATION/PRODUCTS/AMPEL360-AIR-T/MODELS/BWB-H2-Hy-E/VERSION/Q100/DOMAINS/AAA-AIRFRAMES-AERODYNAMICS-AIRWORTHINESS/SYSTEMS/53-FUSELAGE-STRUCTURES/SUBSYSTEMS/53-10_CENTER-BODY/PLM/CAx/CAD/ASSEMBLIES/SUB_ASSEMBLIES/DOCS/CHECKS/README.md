## Visual Inspection

Surface and workmanship inspection:
- **Surface condition**: Scratches, dents, corrosion
- **Cleanliness**: Contamination, foreign objects

- **Rework procedures**: How to correct defects

## Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)

Common NDT methods:
- **X-ray radiography**: Internal defects, porosity, cracks

- **Eddy current**: Surface and near-surface cracks
- **Magnetic particle**: Surface and near-surface defects (ferrous materials)
- **Penetrant testing**: Surface-breaking defects
- **Visual inspection**: Enhanced with borescopes, mirrors

### NDT Requirements
- **Qualified technicians**: Certified NDT Level II or III
- **Written procedures**: Per ASTM, ASNT, or MIL standards
