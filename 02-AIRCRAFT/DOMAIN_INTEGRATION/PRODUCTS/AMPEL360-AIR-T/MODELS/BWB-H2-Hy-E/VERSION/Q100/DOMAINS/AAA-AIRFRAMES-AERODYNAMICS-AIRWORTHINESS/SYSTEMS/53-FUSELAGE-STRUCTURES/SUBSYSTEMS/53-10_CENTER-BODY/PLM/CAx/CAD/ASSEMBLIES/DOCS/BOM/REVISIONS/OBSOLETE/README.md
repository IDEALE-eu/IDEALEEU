# OBSOLETE — Obsolete and Superseded BOMs

## Purpose

This directory archives Bills of Materials that have been superseded by newer revisions or are no longer applicable. These BOMs are retained for historical reference and traceability.

## Contents

Obsolete BOMs include:
- Superseded revisions
- Retired configurations
- Historical baselines
- Discontinued designs

## Status Criteria

A BOM becomes OBSOLETE when:
- Superseded by newer revision
- Configuration no longer used
- Design discontinued
- Product end-of-life

## File Management

### Naming Convention
```
53-10_BOM_<assembly-id>_<bom-type>_r<revision>_OBSOLETE.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_BOM_CENTER-BODY_EBOM_r001_OBSOLETE.csv`
- `53-10_BOM_FRAME-F05_MBOM_r002_OBSOLETE.xlsx`

### Retention
- Maintain for full product lifecycle
- Do not delete obsolete BOMs
- Preserve for regulatory compliance
- Archive for historical reference

## Usage

- Historical reference
- Traceability and audits
- Understanding design evolution
- Supporting legacy configurations
- Regulatory compliance

## Metadata

Each obsolete BOM should document:
- Date made obsolete
- Reason for obsolescence
- Superseding BOM revision
- Effectivity period
- Related engineering changes

## Access

Obsolete BOMs are:
- Read-only
- Not for production use
- Available for reference only
- Clearly marked as obsolete

## Traceability

Maintain links to:
- Superseding BOM revisions
- Engineering change notices
- Configuration baseline records
- Production records using this BOM
- As-built aircraft affected

## Retrieval

When referencing obsolete BOMs:
- Verify BOM is obsolete status
- Check superseding revision
- Understand applicability
- Use only for historical context

## Compliance
