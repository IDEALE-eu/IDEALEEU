# QA — Quality Assurance

## Purpose
Quality assurance, validation, and reproducibility checks for optimization workflows.

## Subdirectories

### [REPRODUCIBILITY/](REPRODUCIBILITY/) — Reproducibility Validation
Ensure optimization runs are reproducible:
- Reference solutions and benchmarks
- Regression test cases
- Seed validation tests
- Configuration snapshots
- Environment specifications (software versions, libraries)
- Determinism checks
- Cross-platform validation

**Purpose**: Verify identical results with same inputs and configuration

### [CHECKS/](CHECKS/) — Quality Checks
Validation and verification procedures:
- Input data validation scripts
- Constraint violation checks
- Physical feasibility checks
- Solution quality metrics
- Convergence diagnostics
- Result sanity checks
- Model validation against test data

**Purpose**: Ensure optimization results are valid and physically meaningful

## Quality Assurance Workflow
1. Validate input data (materials, loads, geometry)
2. Check problem formulation completeness
3. Verify solver configuration
4. Monitor convergence quality
5. Validate optimized designs
6. Document assumptions and limitations
7. Conduct peer review

## Test Cases
- Benchmark problems with known solutions
- Unit tests for custom scripts
- Integration tests for coupled workflows
- Regression tests for code changes

## Guidelines
- Run reproducibility checks regularly
- Maintain test case library
- Document failed checks and resolutions
- Update checks when methods change
- Archive validation evidence
