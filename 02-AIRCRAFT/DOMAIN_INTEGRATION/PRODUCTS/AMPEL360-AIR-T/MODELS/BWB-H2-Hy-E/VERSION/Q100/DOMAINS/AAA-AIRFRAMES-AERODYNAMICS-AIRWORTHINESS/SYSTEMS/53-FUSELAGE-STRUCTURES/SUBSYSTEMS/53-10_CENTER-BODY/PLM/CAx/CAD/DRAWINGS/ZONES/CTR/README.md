# CTR â€” Center Zone Drawings

## Purpose

This directory contains or references drawings for components located in the Center (CTR) zone of the 53-10 Center Body subsystem.

## Zone Definition

### Center Zone Boundaries
- **Forward limit**: Approximately at wing leading edge
- **Aft limit**: Approximately at wing trailing edge
- **Typical stations**: FS 500 to FS 1000 (example - adjust based on actual design)

### Major Components

#### Primary Structure
- **Frames**: F11, F12, F13, F14, F15, F16, F17, F18, F19, F20
- **Wing carry-through structure**: Main wing box integration
- **Main landing gear bulkheads**: Landing gear bay structure
- **Keel beam**: Center section of keel beam
- **Floor beams**: Main cabin floor structure

#### Secondary Structure
- **Stringers**: Center stringers (upper and lower)
- **Skin panels**: Center outer and inner skin panels
- **Doublers**: Local reinforcements at high-load areas
- **Splice plates**: Joint fittings in center zone

#### Interfaces
- **Wing interface**: Wing-to-body attachment (both sides)
- **Main landing gear**: Landing gear bay and attachment points
- **Fuel tank boundaries**: Wing and center fuel tank interfaces
- **Keel beam continuity**: Through-structure load path

## Organization

### Drawing References
This directory can contain:
- **Symbolic links**: Links to drawings in type directories (PART/, ASSEMBLY/, etc.)
- **Index file**: List of all CTR zone drawings with references
- **Zone package**: Combined PDF package of all CTR zone drawings

### Index File
Create `CTR_ZONE_INDEX.md` listing:
- Component name and part number
- Drawing number and revision
- Drawing type (Part, Assembly, Installation, etc.)
- Path to drawing file
- Status (Draft, Released, Obsolete)

## Manufacturing Sequence

### CTR Zone Build Sequence
1. **Wing carry-through structure**: Build wing box integration structure
2. **Frame sub-assemblies**: Assemble center frames with fittings
3. **Landing gear bulkheads**: Install landing gear bay structure
4. **Stringer installation**: Install stringers on frames
5. **Inner skin**: Install inner skin panels
6. **Floor structure**: Install center cabin floor beams
7. **Outer skin**: Install outer skin panels
8. **Wing interface prep**: Prepare wing attachment interfaces
9. **Systems provisions**: Install system brackets and fittings

## Critical Features

### High-Load Areas
- Wing attachment fittings (primary load path)
- Landing gear trunnion supports
- Keel beam through-structure
- Floor beam to frame attachments
- Wing carry-through shear webs

### Interfaces Requiring Special Attention
- Wing-to-body joint (tolerance critical)
- Landing gear door interfaces
- Fuel tank sealing provisions
- Systems penetrations through pressure boundary

## Quality Control

### CTR Zone Inspection Points
- Wing interface dimensional check (critical)
- Landing gear attachment alignment
- Frame assembly dimensional check
- Stringer alignment verification
- Skin panel fit and gap check
- Fuel tank sealing inspection
- Fastener installation inspection
- Interface dimension verification
- Final zone dimensional audit

- Support manufacturing questions
- Coordinate wing installation sequence

### Interface Management
- Maintain wing interface dimensions rigorously
- Coordinate with landing gear integration team
- Verify fuel tank sealing provisions
- Track interface changes through CCB
- Document interface verification results
