# CAE â€” Computer-Aided Engineering

## Purpose
Structural analysis, thermal analysis, and electromagnetic simulation for pylon primary structure.

## Contents
- Finite element analysis models (static, dynamic, fatigue)
- Thermal-structural coupling analysis
- Electromagnetic-structural interaction studies
- Vibration and modal analysis results
- Multi-physics simulation for hybrid-electric propulsion

## Formats
- FEA models (NASTRAN, ANSYS, ABAQUS)
- Analysis results (reports, plots, animations)
- Optimization studies (topology, multi-objective)

## Guidelines
- Document load cases and boundary conditions
- Include electromagnetic force effects
- Validate thermal expansion predictions
- Link analysis to test evidence
