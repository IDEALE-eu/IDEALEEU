# IRR — Integration Readiness Review

## Purpose

Integration Readiness Review (IRR) artifacts confirming all integration activities are complete and the CENTER-BODY subsystem is ready for final assembly.

## Content Types

- **IRR Presentation Materials** — Readiness assessment briefings
- **Integration Completion Evidence** — Verification of all activities
- **Interface Closure Documentation** — Final interface sign-offs
- **Lessons Learned** — Documentation of integration insights

## File Formats

- `.pdf` — IRR presentations and reports
- `.xlsx` — Completion tracking matrices

## IRR Objectives

IRR confirms:
- All integration work complete
- All interfaces physically verified
- Assembly procedures validated
- Tooling and fixtures ready
- Team ready for final assembly

## IRR Review Scope

- Interface hardware fit-check results
- Assembly procedure validation
- Tooling qualification status
- Access and clearance verification
- Final integration documentation complete
- Team training and certification

## IRR Exit Criteria

To pass IRR:
- [ ] All interfaces physically fit-checked
- [ ] Assembly procedures validated
- [ ] Tooling qualified and available
- [ ] All personnel trained and certified
- [ ] Integration documentation complete
- [ ] All CDR actions closed
- [ ] Ready to proceed to final assembly

## IRR Deliverables

- Integration completion certificate
- Interface closure sign-offs (all parties)
- Assembly procedure validation reports
- Tooling qualification reports
- Team readiness assessment
- Lessons learned documentation

## Post-IRR Activities

After IRR approval:
- Proceed to final assembly
- Execute assembly procedures
- Monitor integration quality
- Document as-built configuration
- Capture additional lessons learned
