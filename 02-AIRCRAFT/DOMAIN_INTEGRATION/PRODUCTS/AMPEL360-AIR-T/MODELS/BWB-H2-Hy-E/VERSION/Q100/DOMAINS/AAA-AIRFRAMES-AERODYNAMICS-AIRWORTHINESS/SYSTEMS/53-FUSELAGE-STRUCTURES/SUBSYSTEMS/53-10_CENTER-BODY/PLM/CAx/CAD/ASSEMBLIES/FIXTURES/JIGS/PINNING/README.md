# PINNING — Hole Location and Fastener Systems

## Purpose

This directory contains hole pattern documentation and hardware specifications for precision hole location and temporary fastening during assembly.

## Contents

### Subdirectories

- **[HOLE_MAPS/](./HOLE_MAPS/)** — Hole pattern layouts and coordinates
- **[HARDWARE/](./HARDWARE/)** — Pin and fastener specifications

## Hole Map Contents

### Pattern Documentation
- Hole coordinate tables (X, Y, Z)
- Hole diameter and tolerance specifications
- Pattern reference datums
- Hole type identification (through, blind, threaded)

### Formats
- CAD models with hole patterns
- Excel/CSV coordinate tables
- PDF drawings with dimensions
- CNC drilling programs

## Hardware Types

### Pins
- Locating pins (diamond, round)
- Quick-release pins
- Spring-loaded pins
- Alignment pins

### Fasteners
- Temporary assembly bolts
- Cleco fasteners
- Quick-disconnect fasteners
- Torque specifications

## Requirements

All pinning documentation should:
- Reference master coordinate system
- Specify hole tolerances (typically ±0.1mm)
- Include inspection methods
- Document hardware specifications
- Provide installation procedures
