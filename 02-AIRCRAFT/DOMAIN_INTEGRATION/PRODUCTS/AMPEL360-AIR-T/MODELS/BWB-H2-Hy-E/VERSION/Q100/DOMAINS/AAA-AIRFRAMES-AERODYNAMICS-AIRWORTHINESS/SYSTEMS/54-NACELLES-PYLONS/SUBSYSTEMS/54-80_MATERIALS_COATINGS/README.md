# 54-80 MATERIALS_COATINGS — Advanced Materials Framework (BWB-H2-Hy-E, Q100)

**Purpose**  
Advanced materials framework for hydrogen and electric propulsion with specialized coatings and material qualification for extreme environments.

## Scope
- Hydrogen-compatible materials resistant to hydrogen embrittlement
- High-temperature ceramic thermal barrier coatings for electric motor cooling
- Electromagnetic shielding conductive coatings for EMI/EMC compliance
- Corrosion-resistant coatings for extended service life
- Advanced composite materials for weight optimization
- Additive manufacturing materials and qualification

## Core Deliverables
- `H2_MATERIALS.md` — Hydrogen-compatible material specifications
- `THERMAL_COATINGS.md` — High-temperature thermal barrier coating systems
- `EMI_COATINGS.md` — Electromagnetic shielding coating specifications
- `CORROSION_PROTECTION.md` — Corrosion-resistant coating systems
- `MATERIAL_SPECS.csv` — Material properties and qualification status

## Interfaces
- **51 Structures (Materials)**, **71 Powerplant**, **28 Fuel (H₂)**, **24 Electrical (EMI/EMC)**  
See `../../INTERFACE_MATRIX/54↔51_71_28_24.csv`.

## Acceptance
- Material testing validates hydrogen compatibility and embrittlement resistance
- Thermal testing validates coating performance at operating temperatures
- EMI/EMC testing validates electromagnetic shielding effectiveness
- Corrosion testing validates long-term environmental durability
- Additive manufacturing parts validated per certification requirements
