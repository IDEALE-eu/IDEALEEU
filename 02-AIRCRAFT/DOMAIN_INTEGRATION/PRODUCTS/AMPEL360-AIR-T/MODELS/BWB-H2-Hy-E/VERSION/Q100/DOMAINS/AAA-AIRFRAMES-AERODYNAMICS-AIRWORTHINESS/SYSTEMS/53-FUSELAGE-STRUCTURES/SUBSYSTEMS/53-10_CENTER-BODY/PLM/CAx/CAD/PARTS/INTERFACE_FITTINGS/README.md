# INTERFACE_FITTINGS â€” System Interface Attachment Parts

## Purpose

This directory contains CAD part files for interface fittings that connect the 53-10 Center Body subsystem to adjacent systems such as wings, nose section, aft section, and empennage. These fittings transfer loads between major structural assemblies.

## Component Description

### Fitting Types
- **Wing attachments**: Wing-to-body interface fittings (front spar, rear spar, center fitting)
- **Nose interface**: Forward fuselage connection fittings
- **Aft interface**: Aft fuselage connection fittings
- **Landing gear**: Landing gear beam/trunnion fittings
- **Engine mounts**: Engine pylon attachment provisions (if applicable)
- **Tail attachments**: Empennage attachment fittings

## Naming Convention

```
53-10_INTERFACE-FITTING_<fitting-id>_<location>_<version>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_INTERFACE-FITTING_IF-WING-FS_FRONT-SPAR_v01.CATPart`
- `53-10_INTERFACE-FITTING_IF-WING-RS_REAR-SPAR_v02.prt`
- `53-10_INTERFACE-FITTING_IF-LG-MAIN_LANDING-GEAR_v01.sldprt`

## Design Considerations

### Structural Requirements
- Transfer ultimate loads per design load cases
- Provide fail-safe and redundant load paths
- Resist fatigue under cyclic loading
- Accommodate assembly tolerances with adjustability
- Provide for disassembly and maintenance access

### Material Specifications
- **High-strength steel**: 4340 or 300M for primary load path
- **Titanium**: Ti-6Al-4V for weight/strength optimization
- **Aluminum**: 7075-T6 for secondary fittings

### Manufacturing Methods
- **Forged**: For primary load fittings (maximum strength)
- **Machined**: From billet for complex geometries
- **Cast**: Titanium investment casting for weight optimization

## Interface Management

### Interface Control Documents (ICDs)
- Reference ICD for mating interface definition
- Verify hole patterns and bolt specifications
- Coordinate with adjacent system design teams
- Document tolerances and assembly procedures

## Cross-References

- **Interface definitions**: [`../../../CAI/INTERFACES/`](../../../CAI/INTERFACES/)
- **Interface matrix**: [`../../../CAI/INTERFACE_MATRIX/`](../../../CAI/INTERFACE_MATRIX/)
- **Frame attachments**: [`../FRAMES/`](../FRAMES/)
- **Fasteners**: [`../FASTENERS/`](../FASTENERS/)
- **Detail drawings**: [`../../DRAWINGS/`](../../DRAWINGS/)

## Quality Requirements

Interface fittings must meet:
- Fatigue life requirements per certification basis
- Ultimate strength with positive margin
- Proof load testing verification
- Material traceability and certifications
- Special processes (heat treat, coating) verification
