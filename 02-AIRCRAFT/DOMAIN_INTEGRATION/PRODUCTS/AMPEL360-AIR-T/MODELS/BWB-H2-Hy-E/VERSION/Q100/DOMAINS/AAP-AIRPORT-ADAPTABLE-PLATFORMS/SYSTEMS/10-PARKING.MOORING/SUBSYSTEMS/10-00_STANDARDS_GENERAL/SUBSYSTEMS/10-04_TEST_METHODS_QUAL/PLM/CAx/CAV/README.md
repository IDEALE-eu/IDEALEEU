# CAV - Computer-Aided Validation

[â†‘ Up to 10-04_TEST_METHODS_QUAL](../../../README.md)

Computer-Aided Validation artifacts for test methods and qualification standards.

## Purpose

Validation test plans, verification procedures, and acceptance criteria supporting the development, verification, and deployment of test methods and qualification standards.

## Structure

- **TEST_PLANS/** - Validation and verification test plans
- **PROCEDURES/** - Test procedures and protocols
- **FIXTURES/** - Test fixture designs
- **DATA/** - Test data and measurements
- **REPORTS/** - Test reports and analysis
- **ACCEPTANCE/** - Acceptance criteria and checklists
- **CORRELATION/** - Test-analysis correlation studies

## Key Artifacts

- Test plans and procedures
- Test fixture specifications
- Measured test data
- Pass/fail criteria
- Validation reports

## Naming Convention

```
10-04_{CAX}_{DESCRIPTION}_v{VER}.{ext}
```

## Standards

- Follow applicable CAV standards and best practices
- Ensure traceability to EBOM items
- Maintain configuration control per CM plan
- Document assumptions and validation basis
- Include metadata and revision history

## File Formats

- **Plans:** PDF/A, Markdown
- **Data:** CSV, Excel, HDF5
- **Reports:** PDF/A with embedded data
- **Media:** Test photos/videos

## Traceability

All CAV artifacts must:
- Link to EBOM items in [PLM/EBOM_LINKS.md](../EBOM_LINKS.md)
- Reference requirements and specifications
- Include verification and validation evidence
- Maintain audit trail of changes
- Support configuration management
