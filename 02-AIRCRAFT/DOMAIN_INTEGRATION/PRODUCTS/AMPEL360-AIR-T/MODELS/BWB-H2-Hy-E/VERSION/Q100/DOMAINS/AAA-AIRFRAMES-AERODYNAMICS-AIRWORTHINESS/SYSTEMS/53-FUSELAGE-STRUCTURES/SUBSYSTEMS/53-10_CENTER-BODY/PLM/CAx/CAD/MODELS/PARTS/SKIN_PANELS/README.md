# SKIN_PANELS â€” Outer and Inner Skin Panels

## Purpose

CAD models for skin panels that form the aerodynamic surface and carry in-plane loads.

## Panel Types

- Outer skin panels (OML)
- Inner skin panels (IML)
- Pressure panels
- Non-pressure panels
- Composite panels
- Hybrid panels

## Naming Convention

```
53-10_SKIN_PANEL_SP-<ZONE>-<ID>_<LOCATION>_v<VERSION>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_SKIN_PANEL_SP-FWD-001_UPPER-LEFT_v01.CATPart`
- `53-10_SKIN_PANEL_SP-AFT-012_LOWER-RIGHT_v02.prt`

## Design Requirements

- Maintain aerodynamic contour
- Withstand pressure differential
- Carry in-plane shear and tension
- Provide stringer attachment
- Meet surface quality requirements
