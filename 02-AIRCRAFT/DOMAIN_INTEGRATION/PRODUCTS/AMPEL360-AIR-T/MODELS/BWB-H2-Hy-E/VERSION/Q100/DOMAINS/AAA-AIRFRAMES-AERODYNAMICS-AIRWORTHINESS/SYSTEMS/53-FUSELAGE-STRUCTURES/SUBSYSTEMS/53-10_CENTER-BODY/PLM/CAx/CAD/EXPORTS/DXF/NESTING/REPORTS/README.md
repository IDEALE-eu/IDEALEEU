# REPORTS — Nesting Reports and Documentation

## Purpose
Documentation and reports related to nesting efficiency, material usage, and optimization.

## Contents
- Nesting efficiency reports
- Material utilization summaries
- Cost analysis reports
- Scrap tracking documentation
- Part production summaries
- Material consumption logs

## Report Types

### Efficiency Reports
- **Nesting efficiency**: Percentage of material used
- **Parts per sheet**: Number of parts nested
- **Material savings**: Comparison to alternative layouts
- **Optimization history**: Improvement over time

### Material Usage Reports
- **Material consumption**: Total material used by type
- **Sheet utilization**: Sheets consumed per job
- **Scrap generation**: Scrap percentage and disposal
- **Remnant tracking**: Reusable remnants inventory

### Cost Reports
- **Material cost**: Cost per nest job
- **Cutting time**: Estimated and actual cutting time
- **Labor cost**: Setup and processing time
- **Cost per part**: Unit cost breakdown

### Production Reports
- **Parts produced**: Quantities by part number
- **Production schedule**: Nesting job timeline
- **Quality metrics**: First-pass yield, rework rate
- **Delivery tracking**: Part availability

## File Formats
Reports typically in:
- PDF for official documentation
- Excel/CSV for data analysis
- DXF for graphical nest layouts (stored in [NEST_JOBS/](../NEST_JOBS/))

## File Naming Convention
```
NEST-REPORT_<type>_<material>_<date>.pdf
```

Examples:
- `NEST-REPORT_EFFICIENCY_AL2024_2025-01.pdf`
- `NEST-REPORT_MATERIAL-USAGE_Q1-2025.pdf`
- `NEST-REPORT_COST-ANALYSIS_2025-01-10.pdf`

## Efficiency Metrics
Track and report:
- **Material utilization**: Target >85%
- **Cutting time efficiency**: Actual vs. estimated
- **Scrap rate**: Target <15%
- **Remnant reuse**: Percentage of remnants utilized
- **Setup time**: Time for job preparation

## Optimization Goals
Continuous improvement:
- Increase nesting efficiency
- Reduce material waste
- Minimize cutting time
- Improve remnant utilization
- Reduce setup time

## Analysis and Review
Regular reviews should include:
- Monthly efficiency trends
- Material cost tracking
- Scrap reduction opportunities
- Process improvement recommendations
- Best practice documentation

## Best Practices
- Generate reports after each nesting job
- Track efficiency trends over time
- Share best practices with team
- Document lessons learned
- Set efficiency targets and monitor
- Regular cost analysis updates

## Data Retention
- Keep reports for minimum 5 years
- Archive old jobs and reports
- Maintain traceability to production records
- Link to quality records if issues arise
