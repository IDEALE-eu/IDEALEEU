# COUPLING — Multi-Physics Coupling

## Purpose
Coupled multi-physics analyses combining structural, thermal, and fluid dynamics for the center body fuselage.

## Subdirectories

### FSI/ — Fluid-Structure Interaction
Coupled fluid-structure interaction analyses for:
- Aeroelastic response to aerodynamic loads
- Pressure loading on flexible structures
- Flutter and divergence analysis
- Panel response to flow-induced vibrations

### THERMO-STRUCTURAL/
Coupled thermal-structural analyses for:
- Thermal expansion and thermal stress
- Cryogenic tank thermal protection
- Heat transfer to structure
- Temperature-dependent material properties

### AEROELASTICITY/
Aeroelastic stability and response analyses:
- Flutter analysis (subsonic/transonic)
- Divergence and control reversal
- Dynamic aeroelastic response
- Gust loads and buffeting

## Supported Tools
