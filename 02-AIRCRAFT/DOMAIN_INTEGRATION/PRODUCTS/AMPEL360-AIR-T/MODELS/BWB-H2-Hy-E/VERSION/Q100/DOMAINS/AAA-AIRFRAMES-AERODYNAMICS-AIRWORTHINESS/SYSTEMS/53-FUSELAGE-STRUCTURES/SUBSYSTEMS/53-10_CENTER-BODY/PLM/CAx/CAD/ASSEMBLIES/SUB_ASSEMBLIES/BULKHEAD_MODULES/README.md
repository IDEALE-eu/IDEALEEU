# BULKHEAD_MODULES — Bulkhead Module Sub-Assemblies

## Purpose

This directory contains sub-assembly models for bulkhead modules of the 53-10 Center Body. Bulkheads are transverse structural partitions that provide pressure containment, compartment separation, and load distribution within the fuselage.

## Organization

Bulkhead modules are organized by bulkhead identifier (BH_XX):
- **BH_01-05**: Forward pressure bulkheads
- **BH_06-10**: Mid-cabin bulkheads
- **BH_11-15**: Aft pressure bulkheads
- **BH_FIRE**: Fire barriers and compartment dividers
- **BH_CARGO**: Cargo compartment bulkheads

## Directory Structure

Each bulkhead module (BH_XX) contains:
- **MODELS/**: CAD assembly files for the bulkhead module
- **DRAWINGS/**: Engineering drawings and manufacturing prints
- **DOCS/**: Documentation including BOM, pressure test results, and specifications

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern for bulkhead module assemblies:
```
53-10_ASM_BULKHEAD_BH-<nn>_v<version>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_ASM_BULKHEAD_BH-01_v01.CATProduct`
- `53-10_ASM_BULKHEAD_BH-05_v02.asm`
- `53-10_ASM_BULKHEAD_BH-12_v01.sldasm`

## Typical Bulkhead Module Contents

A bulkhead module assembly typically includes:
- **Primary bulkhead**: Main structural diaphragm or web
- **Stiffeners**: Radial or circumferential reinforcements
- **Frame attachments**: Fittings to connect to fuselage frames
- **Penetrations**: Doors, ducts, cable pass-throughs
- **Reinforcements**: Local doublers at high-stress areas
- **Sealing elements**: Pressure seals and gaskets
- **Access panels**: Removable panels for systems maintenance

## Bulkhead Types

### Pressure Bulkheads
- **Forward pressure bulkhead**: Cockpit/cabin separation
- **Aft pressure bulkhead**: Cabin/unpressurized tail cone separation
- **Design pressure**: Typically 8.5-9.0 psi differential
- **Ultimate load factor**: 2.0 x limit pressure

### Non-Pressure Bulkheads
- **Cargo compartment dividers**: Class C cargo separation
- **Fire barriers**: Fire/smoke containment (60-minute rating)
- **Structural bulkheads**: Load-bearing partitions
- **Acoustic barriers**: Sound isolation between compartments

## Integration Points

Bulkhead modules interface with:
- **Frame sections**: Bulkhead-to-frame attachments at periphery
- **Floor modules**: Floor beam connections through bulkhead
- **Door surrounds**: Door frame integration at cutouts
- **Systems installations**: Cable, duct, and pipe penetrations
- **Windows**: Window installations in forward bulkhead
- **Pressure systems**: Environmental control system (ECS) interfaces

## Design Guidelines

### Structural Design
- Design for pressure differential loads
- Include proper load paths to primary structure
- Validate stiffener spacing and sizing
- Design for fatigue (pressurization cycles)
- Include proper edge attachments

### Pressure Containment
- Ensure continuous pressure boundary
- Design seals for pressure cycling
- Include pressure relief provisions if required
- Validate penetration sealing
- Plan for leak testing during assembly

### Penetration Management
- Minimize number and size of penetrations
- Reinforce all cutouts and pass-throughs
- Design for proper sealing of penetrations
- Include fire barriers at penetrations
- Document all penetration locations

## Load Considerations

### Pressure Loads
- **Differential pressure**: Cabin vs. ambient (8.5 psi typical)
- **Pressure distribution**: Uniform normal pressure
- **Fatigue loads**: Cyclic pressurization (design for aircraft life)
- **Proof pressure test**: 1.33 x design pressure

### Mechanical Loads
- **Attachment loads**: Seat, equipment, and cargo restraint reactions
- **Impact loads**: Emergency landing and crash loads
- **Thermal loads**: Temperature gradients and thermal cycling

## Penetration Types

Common penetrations requiring sealing and reinforcement:
- **Doors**: Passenger, cargo, or service doors
- **Ducts**: Air conditioning and ventilation ducts
- **Cables**: Electrical wiring bundles
- **Pipes**: Hydraulic and pneumatic lines
- **Windows**: Cockpit or cabin windows (forward bulkhead)
- **Access panels**: Maintenance access doors

## Sealing Requirements

For pressure bulkheads:
- **Primary seals**: Continuous gasket or sealant at periphery
- **Secondary seals**: Redundant sealing at critical locations
- **Penetration seals**: Grommets or boots at cable/pipe pass-throughs
- **Access panel seals**: Gasketed removable panels
- **Leak rate**: Not to exceed X SCFM at design pressure

## Metadata Requirements

Each bulkhead module should include:
- **Part number**: Following 53-10 numbering system
- **Description**: Bulkhead location and type
- **Station location**: Fuselage station (FS) of bulkhead
- **Pressure type**: Pressurized or non-pressurized
- **Design pressure**: Maximum differential pressure (if applicable)
- **Material**: Primary materials and finishes
- **Mass properties**: Weight and CG
- **Status**: Design state (draft, released, obsolete)

## Testing and Certification

### Structural Testing
- **Static pressure test**: Proof pressure to 1.33 x design
- **Ultimate pressure test**: Test to failure (typically 2.0 x design)
- **Fatigue test**: Cyclic pressurization for design life
- **Leak test**: Pressure decay test to verify sealing

### Fire Testing
For fire barrier bulkheads:
- **Burn-through test**: 60-minute fire resistance
- **Smoke penetration test**: Smoke seal effectiveness
- **Material flammability**: FAR 25.853 compliance

### Documentation
- Test plans and procedures
- Test reports with results and photographs
- Certification reports for regulatory compliance
- Inspection and acceptance criteria

## Manufacturing Considerations

### Fabrication Planning
- Consider forming/machining capabilities
- Plan for large panel handling
- Design for sub-assembly outside aircraft
- Include assembly alignment features
- Document dimensional inspection requirements

### Installation Planning
- Design for installation through fuselage opening
- Plan for installation sequence
- Consider tooling and fixture requirements
- Include temporary support provisions
- Document torque requirements for all fasteners

## Quality Assurance

Critical quality checks:
- Dimensional accuracy of bulkhead profile
- Proper alignment with fuselage frames
- Complete penetration sealing
- Pressure test leak check
- Surface finish and corrosion protection

## Version Control

- Use Git LFS for large assembly files (> 10 MB)
- Tag design reviews and pressure test validations
- Document pressure rating or configuration changes
- Maintain revision history for each bulkhead
- Track penetration additions or modifications
