[← Back to COST](../README.md) | [↑ Up to CMP](../../README.md)

Projected final costs based on current performance.

## Structure

- **[EAC/](EAC/)** - Estimate at Completion
- **[ETC/](ETC/)** - Estimate to Complete

## Purpose

Project final costs using:
- Historical performance
- Current trends
- Known changes
- Risk assessment

1. **Performance-based** - EAC = BAC / CPI
2. **Manager estimate** - Bottom-up reestimate
3. **Composite** - Blend of methods
