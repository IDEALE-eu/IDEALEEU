# CAD â€” Computer-Aided Design

## Purpose
Mechanical design models and drawings for structural general standards.

## Contents
- Parametric joint typologies (riveted, bolted, bonded, co-bonded)
- Standard fastener models and families
- Structural detail reference designs
- Assembly models for typical structural connections

## Formats
- Native CAD files (CATIA, NX, etc.)
- Neutral formats (STEP, JT, glTF)
- 2D drawings (PDF, DXF)

## Guidelines
- Use neutral formats alongside native files for long-term accessibility
- Include design parameters and constraints documentation
- Link to allowables and margin policies in file metadata
