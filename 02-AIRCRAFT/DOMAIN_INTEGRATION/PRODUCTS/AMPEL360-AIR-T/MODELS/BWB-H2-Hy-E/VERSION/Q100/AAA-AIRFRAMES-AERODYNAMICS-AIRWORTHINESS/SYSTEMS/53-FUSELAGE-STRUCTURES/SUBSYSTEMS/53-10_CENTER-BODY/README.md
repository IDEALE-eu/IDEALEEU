- Integration with BWB (Blended Wing Body) structural configuration
- Compliance with hydrogen fuel system requirements for H2 compatibility
- Structural optimization using QUANTUM_OA framework
- Critical load path integration between wing box and central fuselage
- Pressurization boundary design for non-cylindrical BWB geometry
- Main landing gear attachment with distributed loads

## Deliverables

- Load path analysis for wing-fuselage integration
- Pressurization vessel analysis for BWB geometry
- Landing gear attachment interface specifications
- Hydrogen storage structural interface definitions
- Manufacturing specifications and processes
- Integration specifications with related systems
- Qualification test evidence and validation reports

## BWB-Specific Integration
- **Load Path Integration**: Seamless load transfer between wing box and central fuselage structure
- **Pressurization Boundaries**: Complex pressure vessel design for non-cylindrical geometry (8.6 psi differential)
- **Landing Gear Integration**: Main gear attachment with distributed loads across BWB structure
- **Hydrogen Storage Interface**: Structural integration for cryogenic fuel tank systems (4,500-5,500 kg LH₂)

## Interfaces
- Inherits conventions from **53-FUSELAGE-STRUCTURES**
- Critical interface with ATA-57 (Wings) for BWB load path integration
- Coordinates with ATA-51 (Structures-General) and ATA-32 (Landing Gear)
- Interfaces with thermal control (ATA-21) for hydrogen systems and cryogenic tank mounting
- Electrical wiring integration (ATA-92)
- Propulsion system mounting (ATA-71)

## Acceptance
- Must comply with BWB structural requirements per Q100 configuration rules
- Material selection validated for hydrogen compatibility
- Load path analysis completed for all critical load cases including wing integration
- Pressurization analysis validated for non-cylindrical geometry
- Landing gear attachment validated for distributed load requirements
- Manufacturing feasibility confirmed

## PLM/CAx
- **CAD**: 3D structural models and assembly definitions
- **CAE**: Finite element analysis, structural validation, and load analysis
- **CAO**: Multi-objective optimization for weight, strength, and manufacturing
- **CAM**: Manufacturing process definitions and tooling requirements
- **CAI**: Interface coordination with adjacent systems
- **CAV**: Verification and validation protocols
- **CAP**: Process automation and workflow management
- **CAS**: Service, maintenance, and repair procedures
- **CMP**: Configuration management and program tracking

## Governance & CM
- Changes via **ECR/ECO** (CCB) after CDR
- Baselines in `00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/04-BASELINES/`
- Traceability through UTCS framework
