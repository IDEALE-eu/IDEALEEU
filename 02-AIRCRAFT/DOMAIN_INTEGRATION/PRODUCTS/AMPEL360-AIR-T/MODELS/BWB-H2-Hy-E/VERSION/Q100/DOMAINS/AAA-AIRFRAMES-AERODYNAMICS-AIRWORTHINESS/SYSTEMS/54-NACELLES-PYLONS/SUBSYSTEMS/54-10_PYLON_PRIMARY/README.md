# 54-10 PYLON_PRIMARY — Propulsion System Integration (BWB-H2-Hy-E, Q100)

**Purpose**  
Primary structural attachment connecting propulsion systems to aircraft structure with advanced distributed electric propulsion and electromagnetic shielding capabilities.

## Scope
- Structural load paths for multiple electric motor installations
- Electromagnetic shielding for EMI/EMC protection of high-power electric propulsion
- Thermal management integration for heat dissipation from electric motors and power electronics
- Advanced vibration isolation systems for electric motor harmonics
- Load distribution framework for hybrid-electric propulsion architecture
