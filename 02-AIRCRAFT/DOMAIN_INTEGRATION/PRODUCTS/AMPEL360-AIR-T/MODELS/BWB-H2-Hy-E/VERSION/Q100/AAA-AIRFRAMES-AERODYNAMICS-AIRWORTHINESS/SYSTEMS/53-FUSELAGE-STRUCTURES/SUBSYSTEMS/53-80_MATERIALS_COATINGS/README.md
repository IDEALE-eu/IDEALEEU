# 53-80_MATERIALS_COATINGS â€” Fuselage Structures (BWB-H2-Hy-E, Q100)

**Purpose**  
Material composition with recyclability and MTL domain integration

## Scope
- Detailed specifications and design artifacts for MATERIALS_COATINGS
- Integration with BWB (Blended Wing Body) structural configuration
- Compliance with hydrogen fuel system requirements for H2 compatibility
- Structural optimization using QUANTUM_OA framework

## Deliverables
- Structural design models and analysis results
- Manufacturing specifications and processes
- Integration specifications with related systems
- Qualification test evidence and validation reports

## Interfaces
- Inherits conventions from **53-FUSELAGE-STRUCTURES**
- Coordinates with ATA-51 (Structures-General), ATA-52 (Doors), ATA-57 (Wings)
- Interfaces with thermal control (ATA-21) for hydrogen systems
- Electrical wiring integration (ATA-92)

## Acceptance
- Must comply with BWB structural requirements per Q100 configuration rules
- Material selection validated for hydrogen compatibility
- Load path analysis completed for all critical load cases
- Manufacturing feasibility confirmed

## PLM/CAx
- **CAD**: 3D structural models and assembly definitions
- **CAE**: Finite element analysis, structural validation, and load analysis
- **CAO**: Multi-objective optimization for weight, strength, and manufacturing
- **CAM**: Manufacturing process definitions and tooling requirements
- **CAI**: Interface coordination with adjacent systems
- **CAV**: Verification and validation protocols
- **CAP**: Process automation and workflow management
- **CAS**: Service, maintenance, and repair procedures
- **CMP**: Configuration management and program tracking

## Governance & CM
