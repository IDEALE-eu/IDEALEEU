# ATA-21 AIR CONDITIONING — Integration View

## Functional Overview
Thermal management system for H₂ hybrid-electric architecture. Manages heat rejection from fuel cells, power electronics, and battery systems.

## Key Dependencies
- **ATA-24**: Electrical load cooling requirements
- **ATA-28**: H₂ conditioning and vaporization heat exchange
- **ATA-30**: Ice protection thermal loops
- **ATA-36**: Cabin pressurization and ECS integration
- **ATA-92**: EWIS for thermal sensors and control

## Operating Modes
- Ground: Pre-cooling and conditioning
- Takeoff: Maximum thermal load management
- Cruise: Steady-state heat rejection
- Descent: Reduced thermal load
- Emergency: Load shedding and fail-safe cooling

## Integration Points
See INTERFACE_MATRIX for detailed cross-system interfaces.
