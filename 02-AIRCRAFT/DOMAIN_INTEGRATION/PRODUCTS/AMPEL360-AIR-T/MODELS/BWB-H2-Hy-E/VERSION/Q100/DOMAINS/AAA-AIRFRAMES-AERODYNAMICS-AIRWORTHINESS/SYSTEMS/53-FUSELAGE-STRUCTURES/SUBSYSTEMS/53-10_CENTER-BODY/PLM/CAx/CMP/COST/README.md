# COST

Cost management and Earned Value Management (EVM) for composite materials subsystem (53-10 Center Body).

## Structure

- **BUDGET/** - Budget baseline and allocations
- **EVM/** - Earned Value Management data (PV, EV, AC)
- **FORECAST/** - Cost forecasts (EAC, ETC)
- **VARIANCE/** - Performance indices (CPI, SPI)

## Purpose

Tracks cost performance, forecasts final costs, and manages budget for composite materials development and manufacturing.

## Key Artifacts

- Budget baseline
- Earned value reports
- Cost forecasts
- Variance analysis
- Performance indices
