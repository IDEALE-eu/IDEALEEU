This is a placeholder for ENERGY_MASS_BALANCE_TEMPLATE.xlsx

The actual Excel template should include the following worksheets:

1. SUMMARY
   - Overall energy and mass balance summary
   - Key performance indicators
   - Comparison to baseline and targets

2. ENERGY_INPUTS
   - System-by-system energy inputs
   - Power consumption breakdown
   - Fuel/H2 chemical energy

3. ENERGY_OUTPUTS
   - Useful work output
   - Waste heat
   - Energy losses

4. HEAT_RECOVERY
   - Heat recovery opportunities
   - Recovery efficiency
   - Energy savings

5. WATER_BALANCE
   - Water inputs (fresh water, condensate)
   - Water outputs (consumption, waste)
   - Reclamation efficiency

6. H2_BALANCE
   - H2 storage and consumption
   - Boil-off rate
   - BOG utilization

7. MATERIAL_FLOW
   - Material inputs (virgin, recycled)
   - Material outputs (to aircraft, to waste)
   - Recycling rate

8. SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS
   - Key parameters and sensitivities
   - Scenario analysis

To create the actual Excel file, use a spreadsheet application and
implement the structure above with appropriate formulas and charts.
