# Verification and Validation Plan (VVP)

## Overview

This plan defines the verification and validation approach for the GENERATION_PROPULSION_ENERGY domain.

## Verification Strategy

### System-Level Verification
- Integration testing of power generation and distribution
- Propulsion system performance testing
- Interface verification across ATA chapters
- Load shedding sequence verification

### Component-Level Verification
- Generator performance testing
- Battery capacity and discharge testing
- FADEC control logic verification
- Engine performance envelope verification
- APU operational testing

## Test Levels

### Level 1 - Component Testing
- Individual LRU testing per specifications
- Environmental testing (DO-160)
- Software testing (DO-178C)
- Hardware testing (DO-254)

### Level 2 - Subsystem Integration
- Power distribution testing
- Engine-FADEC integration
- Bleed air system integration
- Control system integration

### Level 3 - System Integration
- Complete power system testing
- Complete propulsion system testing
- Cross-system interface verification
- Emergency mode verification

### Level 4 - Aircraft Integration
- Ground testing on aircraft
- Engine runs and taxi tests
- Flight testing
- Certification testing

## Test Cases
