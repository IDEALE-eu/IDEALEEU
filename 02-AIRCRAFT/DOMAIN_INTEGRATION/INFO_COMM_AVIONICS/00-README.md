# INFO_COMM_AVIONICS

Information, Communications, and Avionics Domain Integration

## Overview

This domain covers the integration of information systems, communication systems, and avionics across ATA chapters 22, 23, 31, 34, 42, 44, 45, and 46. It provides a unified view of data flows, interfaces, and system integration for avionics networks and digital systems.

## Scope

### Included Systems

- **ATA-22**: Auto Flight (AFCS/AP/FD)
- **ATA-23**: Communications (VHF/HF/SATCOM, datalink, interphone/PA, Wi-Fi/5G)
- **ATA-31**: Indicating & Recording (Displays/EIS, DAU, FDR/CVR/QAR, data buses)
- **ATA-34**: Navigation (GNSS/IRS, radionav, FMS)
- **ATA-42**: Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA chassis, partitions, AFDX/ARINC429)
- **ATA-44**: Cabin Systems (IFE/Connectivity only - relevant to info/comm)
- **ATA-45**: Central Maintenance (CMC, BITE, FOQA)
- **ATA-46**: Information Systems (Data loaders, servers, cybersecurity)

### Key Principles

1. **Software with Host LRU**: Software configurations managed within their host LRU chapter
2. **EWIS Only ATA-92**: All wiring specifications reside in ATA-92_EWIS per CONFIGURATION_BASE rules
3. **No Authority Duplication**: This domain does not duplicate CONFIGURATION_BASE authority - it provides integration views only
4. **Interface Focus**: Primary focus on system interfaces, data flows, and integration patterns

## Rules

### Rule 1: Software Configuration Authority

**Statement**: Software configurations remain with their host LRU in CONFIGURATION_BASE.

**Rationale**: Maintain single source of truth for LRU configurations per CONFIGURATION_BASE rules.

**Implementation**:
- Software versions → CONFIGURATION_BASE/ATA-XX/SW_BASELINE/
- Software loading procedures → ATA-46 data loading processes
- Partition maps → ATA-42-90 (reference to host applications)

### Rule 2: EWIS Centralization

**Statement**: All EWIS configurations reside ONLY in CONFIGURATION_BASE/ATA-92_EWIS.

**Rationale**: Regulatory compliance and centralized wire management.

**Implementation**:
- Wire routing and harnesses → ATA-92_EWIS
- Connector types and pinouts → ATA-92_EWIS
- Signal definitions in interface matrices → This domain (reference only)
- Physical installation → ATA-92_EWIS

### Rule 3: Integration View Only

**Statement**: This domain provides integration views and does not duplicate CONFIGURATION_BASE authority.

**Rationale**: Avoid conflicting sources of truth for configuration items.

**Implementation**:
- Integration views describe system interactions
- Interface matrices reference ICDs in CONFIG_MGMT/09-INTERFACES/
- PLM artifacts link to authoritative CONFIGURATION_BASE locations
- Digital twin anchors provide traceability without duplication

### Rule 4: Interface Management

**Statement**: All interfaces documented in matrix format with ICD references.

**Rationale**: Systematic interface control and traceability.

**Implementation**:
- Interface matrices at system and domain levels
- ICD references point to CONFIG_MGMT/09-INTERFACES/
- Interface changes via ECR/ECO process
- Version control of interface definitions

## Integration Philosophy

### Data Flow Centric
Integration views focus on data flows through avionics networks (AFDX, ARINC 429, etc.) rather than static configurations.

### Network Architecture
Document network topology, QoS requirements, latency budgets, and redundancy strategies.

### Deterministic Systems
Ensure deterministic behavior through partition scheduling, network QoS, and time synchronization.

### Cybersecurity
Integrate DO-326A/355/356A requirements throughout the architecture.
