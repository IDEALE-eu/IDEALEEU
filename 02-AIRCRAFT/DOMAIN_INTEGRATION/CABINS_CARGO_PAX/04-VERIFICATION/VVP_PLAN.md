# Verification & Validation Plan - CABINS_CARGO_PAX Domain

## Purpose

This document defines the verification and validation (V&V) strategy for the CABINS_CARGO_PAX domain integration.

## Scope

Verification and validation covers:
1. Integration of cabin, cargo, and passenger experience systems
2. Interface verification between systems
3. Performance validation against requirements
4. Safety and certification compliance
5. Operational readiness

## V&V Strategy

### Verification Approach

**Verification** confirms that systems are built correctly (to specifications):
- Design reviews
- Analysis and calculations
- Inspections
- Testing (bench, integration, system)

### Validation Approach

**Validation** confirms that systems meet stakeholder needs:
- Operational testing
- Flight testing
- User acceptance testing
- Performance demonstrations

## V&V Levels

### Level 1: Component/Subsystem Verification
- Individual ATA subsystem verification
- Supplier qualification testing
- Component acceptance testing

### Level 2: System Integration Verification
- Interface verification between subsystems
- Integration testing at system level
