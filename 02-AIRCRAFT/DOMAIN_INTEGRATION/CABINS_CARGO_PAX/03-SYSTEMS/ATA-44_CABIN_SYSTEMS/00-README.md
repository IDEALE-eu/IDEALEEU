## Key Integration Points

### Internal (within ATA-44)
- CMS to IFE data exchange
- Network infrastructure supporting all systems
- Lighting control through CMS
- Passenger connectivity through cabin network

### External (to other systems)
- IMA platform hosting (ATA-42)
- Power distribution (ATA-24)
- PSU controls (ATA-25-70)
- Cabin lighting (ATA-33)

## Network Architecture

### Backbone
- ARINC 664 (AFDX) for critical systems
- Ethernet for entertainment and connectivity
- Redundant switches for reliability

### Bandwidth Allocation
- CMS: 10 Mbps (critical)
- IFE backend: 100 Mbps
- Passenger connectivity: 100+ Mbps (scalable)
- System monitoring: 10 Mbps

## Subsystems Integrated

- ATA-44-10: Cabin Management System (CMS)
