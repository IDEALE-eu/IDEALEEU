## Key Integration Points

### Internal (within ATA-50)
- ULD locks to floor structure
- PDUs to power distribution
- Load cells to control electronics
- Cargo fire detection integration

### External (to other systems)
- Floor structure (ATA-51/52)
- Electrical power (ATA-24)
- Fire detection (ATA-26)
- Weight & balance system (ATA-31)
- CMS monitoring (ATA-44)

## Cargo Compartments

### Main Deck (if applicable)
- Forward positions
- Aft positions
- ULD types supported
- Access and loading equipment

### Lower Deck
- Forward cargo compartment
- Aft cargo compartment
- Bulk cargo area
- Accessibility and loading

## Load Management

### Weight Distribution
- Load cells at each ULD position
- Real-time weight monitoring
- Center of gravity calculation
- Load limit enforcement

### Restraint Requirements
- ULD lock specifications
- Minimum locking force
- Safety margins
- Emergency release capability
