## Integration Philosophy

The aircraft is designed using a top-down integration approach:
1. System-level requirements flow down to domains
2. Domains develop subsystems meeting requirements
3. Cross-system integration ensures compatibility
4. Digital twin validates complete system behavior
5. Final assembly executes the physical integration

## Threading Functional Architecture/Artifact (TFA)

The new **[MODEL_IDENTIFICATION/](./MODEL_IDENTIFICATION/)** structure implements the Threading Functional Architecture/Artifact (TFA) that organizes aircraft configurations by:

- **Product**: Aircraft product line (e.g., AMPEL360-AIR-T)
- **Architecture**: Configuration variant (e.g., BWB-H2-Hy-E)
- **Family**: Product family (e.g., Q100_STD01)
- **Domain**: Engineering domain (e.g., AAA-AIRFRAMES-AERODYNAMICS-AIRWORTHINESS)
- **ATA Chapter**: ATA Spec 100 chapters (e.g., ATA-53 Fuselage)
- **Systems**: Specific systems (e.g., ATA-53-10 Center Body)

Each system contains:
- **PLM/CAx**: Product Lifecycle Management artifacts (CAD, CAE, CAM, etc.)
- **CONF/BASELINE**: Configuration management with component tracking, subproducts, subjects, and artifacts

This structure enables:
- ATA Spec 100 / iSpec 2200 compliance
- Traceability from requirements to artifacts
- Configuration control and baseline management
- Multi-domain system integration
- Effectivity range management
