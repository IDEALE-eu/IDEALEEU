## Integration Philosophy

The aircraft is designed using a top-down integration approach:
1. System-level requirements flow down to domains
2. Domains develop subsystems meeting requirements
3. Cross-system integration ensures compatibility
4. Digital twin validates complete system behavior
5. Final assembly executes the physical integration
