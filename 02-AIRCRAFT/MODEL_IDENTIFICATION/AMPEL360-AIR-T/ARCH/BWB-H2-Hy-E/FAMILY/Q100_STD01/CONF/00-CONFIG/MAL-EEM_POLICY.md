# MAL-EEM Policy - Machine Learning Ethics, Equity, and Mitigation

## Purpose

This policy defines requirements for AI/ML components in the Q100_STD01 configuration, ensuring ethical deployment, fairness, and explainability in accordance with EU AI Act principles.

---

## Scope

Applies to all machine learning and AI systems integrated into:
- Federated learning workflows (FE phase)
- Predictive maintenance models
- Energy optimization algorithms
- Flight path optimization
- Sensor fusion and anomaly detection

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Bias Mitigation

**Requirement**: All ML models must be evaluated for bias across protected characteristics.

**Protected Characteristics**:
- Geographic region (flight routes)
- Operator type (commercial, private, cargo)
- Environmental conditions (climate, altitude)
- Temporal factors (time of day, season)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Diverse training data collection (minimum 5 regions)
- Bias detection metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds)
- Regular model audits (quarterly)
- Bias correction techniques (reweighting, adversarial debiasing)

**Metrics**:
```yaml
bias_metrics:
  demographic_parity_diff_max: 0.05
  equalized_odds_diff_max: 0.10
  disparate_impact_min: 0.80
```

---

### 2. Fairness

**Requirement**: ML models must not systematically disadvantage any operator or operational scenario.

**Fairness Criteria**:
- **Individual Fairness**: Similar flights should receive similar predictions
- **Group Fairness**: Performance metrics should be consistent across operator types
- **Counterfactual Fairness**: Predictions should not depend on protected attributes

**Testing**:
- Fairness test suite with 1000+ scenarios
- Cross-validation across operator types
- Sensitivity analysis on input features

---

### 3. Explainability

**Requirement**: All ML predictions must be explainable to domain experts and regulators.

**Explainability Methods**:
- **Feature Importance**: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
- **Local Explanations**: LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- **Global Understanding**: Partial dependence plots, ICE curves
- **Decision Paths**: Tree-based models with traceable decisions

**Documentation**:
- Model cards (per Google Model Card framework)
- Explainability reports (per prediction or batch)
- Feature attribution logs

**Example**:
```yaml
model_card:
  model_name: "H2_Boiloff_Predictor_v2.3"
  purpose: "Predict LH₂ boil-off rate based on ambient conditions"
  training_data: "5 years flight data, 10 operators, 15 regions"
  accuracy: 0.92
  bias_metrics:
    demographic_parity: 0.03
    equalized_odds: 0.07
  explainability: "SHAP values available for all predictions"
```

---

### 4. Transparency

**Requirement**: ML model development and deployment must be transparent to stakeholders.

**Transparency Requirements**:
- Open documentation of model architecture
- Public disclosure of training data sources (anonymized)
- Version-controlled model artifacts
- Regular stakeholder briefings

**Artifacts**:
- `MODEL_REGISTRY.yaml`: Catalog of all ML models
- `TRAINING_DATA_MANIFEST.csv`: Data provenance
- `MODEL_PERFORMANCE_REPORTS/`: Monthly performance updates

---

### 5. Accountability

**Requirement**: Clear ownership and responsibility for ML system decisions.

**Accountability Structure**:
- **Model Owner**: Domain steward responsible for model
- **Data Steward**: Ensures data quality and compliance
- **Ethics Review Board**: Quarterly review of ML deployments
- **Incident Response**: Process for handling ML failures

**Contact**:
- ML Ethics Lead: `ml-ethics@idealeeu.eu`
- Data Protection Officer: `dpo@idealeeu.eu`

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk ML Applications

Per EU AI Act Annex III, the following are considered high-risk:
- Safety-critical flight control algorithms
- Predictive maintenance affecting airworthiness
- Energy management systems impacting range

**Additional Requirements**:
- Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions
- Regular third-party audits
- Conformity assessment per EU AI Act

### Low-Risk ML Applications

- Cabin temperature optimization
- Ground operations scheduling
- Non-critical sensor fusion

**Requirements**:
- Standard bias and fairness testing
- Annual review

---

## Compliance Verification

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Model card completed
- [ ] Bias metrics within limits
- [ ] Fairness testing passed
- [ ] Explainability methods implemented
- [ ] Training data documented
- [ ] Ethics review board approval
- [ ] Incident response plan defined

### Ongoing Monitoring

- **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, bias, fairness, data drift
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for metric degradation
- **Reporting**: Quarterly reports to CCB

---

## Data Governance

### Training Data Requirements

- **Privacy**: GDPR-compliant (anonymization, right to be forgotten)
- **Quality**: Data validation pipelines, outlier detection
- **Diversity**: Representative of operational envelope
- **Provenance**: Full lineage tracking

### Federated Learning

For fleet-wide learning (FE phase):
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Differential privacy (ε ≤ 1.0)
- **Secure Aggregation**: No raw data leaves aircraft
- **Opt-Out**: Operators can opt out of data sharing

---

## Incident Response

### ML Failure Classification

1. **Critical**: Safety-impacting prediction error
2. **Major**: Significant performance degradation
3. **Minor**: Isolated prediction anomaly

### Response Procedures

**Critical**:
1. Immediately disable ML system
2. Notify EASA and operators
3. Root cause analysis within 24 hours
4. Corrective action plan within 7 days

**Major**:
1. Increase monitoring frequency
2. Investigate within 72 hours
3. Model update or rollback decision

**Minor**:
1. Log for quarterly review
2. Analyze patterns
