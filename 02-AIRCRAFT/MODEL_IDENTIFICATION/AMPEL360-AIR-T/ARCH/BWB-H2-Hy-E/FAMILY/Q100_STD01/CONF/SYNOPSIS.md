- **Noise**: EPNL < 85 dB (cumulative), 15 dB below ICAO Chapter 14
- **Energy Efficiency**: 20.2 MJ/km (specific energy consumption)

---

## Compliance & Certification

- **Airworthiness**: EASA CS-25 (Large Aeroplanes)
- **Hydrogen Safety**: EASA SC-H2 Draft v0.3, SAE AS6858
- **Environmental**: Clean Aviation WP3 targets
- **Cybersecurity**: RTCA DO-326A / EUROCAE ED-202A

---

## Integration Philosophy

**QS → FWD → UE → FE → CB → QB**

The configuration crystallized from a quantum superposition (QS) of design alternatives, progressed through forward prediction (FWD), unit element definition (UE), federated learning (FE), and finalized as a crystallized baseline (CB). Quantum optimization (QB) continues for mass and routing efficiency.
