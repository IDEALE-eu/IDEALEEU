# SIMPLIFIED — Simplified Geometry Configurations

## Purpose

JT files with simplified geometry configurations. These models have reduced geometric complexity while maintaining essential design characteristics.

## What to Store

- Simplified assembly models
- Reduced geometric detail
- Essential features only
- Analysis-ready configurations

## Simplification Approach

- Remove non-critical features (fillets, chamfers, small holes)
- Simplify complex surfaces
- Reduce part count where appropriate
- Maintain critical dimensions and interfaces

## Usage

Use simplified configurations for:
- Computational analysis (CFD, FEA prep)
- Early design reviews
- Conceptual presentations
- Fast visualization
- Training and education
- Marketing materials

## Characteristics

- **Geometry**: Simplified but recognizable
- **Features**: Essential features only
- **File size**: Smaller than standard models
- **Detail level**: Concept/overview level

## Best Practices

- Document simplifications made
- Maintain critical interfaces
- Preserve overall shape and proportions
- Use for non-engineering stakeholders
- Suitable for public presentations
