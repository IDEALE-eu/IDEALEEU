# SEQUENCE — Assembly Sequence Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains assembly sequence documentation that defines the step-by-step procedures for assembling the 53-10 Center Body components and subsystems.

## Contents

### Sequence Document Types
- **Assembly procedures**: Detailed step-by-step instructions
- **Fastener schedules**: Fastener installation sequences and specifications
- **Inspection checkpoints**: Quality verification points
- **Tool requirements**: Required tooling and equipment

## Assembly Sequence Categories

### Component Assembly
- Frame installation sequence
- Stringer attachment sequence
- Skin panel installation sequence
- Fastener installation patterns

### Sub-Assembly Integration
- Frame section assembly
- Panel sub-assembly procedures
- Bulkhead installation
- Internal structure integration

### System Installation
- Wing interface assembly
- Door frame installation
- Equipment mounting sequence
- System integration procedures

## Sequence Document Structure

### Standard Sections

#### 1. Scope and Prerequisites
- Assembly identification
- Required prior work
- Precautions and warnings
- Required personnel qualifications

#### 2. Tools and Materials
- Tooling list
- Consumables required
- Fastener kits
- Sealants and adhesives

#### 3. Assembly Steps
Numbered sequential steps with:
- Action description
- Reference drawings/models
- Torque specifications
- Critical dimensions
- Quality checkpoints

#### 4. Verification
- Dimensional checks
- Functional tests
- Documentation requirements
- Sign-off requirements

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern:
```
53-10_SEQ_<assembly-id>_<version>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_SEQ_FRAME-F05-INSTALL_v01.pdf`
- `53-10_SEQ_WING-ATTACH_v02.pdf`
- `53-10_SEQ_CENTER-BODY-COMPLETE_v01.pdf`

## Sequence Development

### Process Steps
1. Analyze assembly design
2. Identify optimal build sequence
3. Document each step with visuals
4. Define quality checkpoints
5. Validate with mock-up or first article
6. Review and approve
7. Release for production

### Considerations
- Part access and clearance
- Tooling requirements
- Fastener patterns and spacing
- Sealant work life
- Cure times
- Inspection access

## Fastener Schedule Format

### Information to Include
- Step number
- Fastener type and size
- Quantity
- Location/pattern
- Torque specification
- Installation sequence
- Special instructions

### Example Format
```
Step 5: Frame F05 to Stringer Attachment
- Fastener: NAS1097-6 rivet
- Quantity: 24
- Pattern: Per drawing 53-10-DWG-001
- Spacing: 50mm ±5mm
- Installation: Start center, work outward
- Inspection: Visual, pull test sample (per AS5350)
```

## Quality Checkpoints

### Checkpoint Types
- Pre-assembly verification
- In-process inspection
- Post-assembly verification
- Final acceptance

### Documentation
Each checkpoint should document:
- What to check
- How to measure/verify
- Acceptance criteria
- Recording requirements
- Non-conformance procedure

## Visual Aids

Include:
- Assembly drawings
- 3D model snapshots
- Photographs (for existing assemblies)
- Exploded views
- Detail callouts

## Integration with Other Systems

### CAD Models
- Reference assembly models in [`../../TOP_LEVEL/`](../../TOP_LEVEL/)
- Reference sub-assemblies in [`../../SUB_ASSEMBLIES/`](../../SUB_ASSEMBLIES/)
