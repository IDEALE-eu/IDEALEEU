# LOD_MED — Medium Level of Detail Parts

## Purpose

Medium level of detail (LOD) JT files for individual parts. These files provide balanced geometry suitable for most visualization and review purposes.

## What to Store

- Medium-resolution part geometry
- Balanced polygon count
- Good visual quality with reasonable file size
- Standard detail representation

## Usage

Use medium LOD parts when:
- Standard design reviews
- Normal assembly visualization
- General collaboration and sharing
- Balance between detail and performance is needed

## File Characteristics

- **File size**: Medium (typically 100 KB - 1 MB per part)
- **Polygon count**: Medium (balanced tessellation)
- **Detail level**: Most features visible
- **Load time**: Moderate

## Best Practices

- Default LOD for most use cases
- Suitable for sub-assembly and section reviews
- Good compromise for PLM system storage
- Recommended for supplier distribution
