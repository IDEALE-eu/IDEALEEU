### CO₂ Endocircular Battery System - Design Specifications

Complete technical design documentation for the closed-loop CO₂-based energy storage system.

**Files**:
- `CO2_BATTERY_TECHNICAL_DOCS.md` - Complete technical reference documentation (13KB)

**Documentation Includes**:
- System architecture and component specifications
- Operating cycles with detailed performance analysis (sublimation, sCO₂ Brayton, CAES-like)
- Thermodynamic background and phase diagrams
- Safety considerations and materials selection
- Integration guidelines for aircraft systems
- Comparison with other storage technologies

**Related Files**:
- Simulation models: `../CAE/co2_battery_endocircular.py` and `test_co2_battery.py`
- Application examples: `../CAI/co2_battery_examples.py`

**Performance Summary**:
- Energy density: ~247 kWh/m³ (thermal)
- Specific energy: 20-70 Wh/kg (electrical, cycle-dependent)
- Discharge efficiency: 15-55% (cycle-dependent)
- Round-trip efficiency: 20-70% (with heat recovery)

## File Organization
