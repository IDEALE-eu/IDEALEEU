notes: |
  This QS state captures all design alternatives considered during the
  Quantum Superposition phase of the AGI-QPLC-CTRL system development.
  
  The selected approach (ALT-02: Quantum-Enhanced Hybrid) represents the
  best balance of capability, safety, and certifiability for human-governed
  AGI oversight in aerospace applications.
  
  All alternatives remain documented for future reference and potential
  revisiting in subsequent versions (QB phase optimization).
  
  Next phase (FWD) will simulate and validate the selected approach under
  various mission profiles and ethical scenarios.
