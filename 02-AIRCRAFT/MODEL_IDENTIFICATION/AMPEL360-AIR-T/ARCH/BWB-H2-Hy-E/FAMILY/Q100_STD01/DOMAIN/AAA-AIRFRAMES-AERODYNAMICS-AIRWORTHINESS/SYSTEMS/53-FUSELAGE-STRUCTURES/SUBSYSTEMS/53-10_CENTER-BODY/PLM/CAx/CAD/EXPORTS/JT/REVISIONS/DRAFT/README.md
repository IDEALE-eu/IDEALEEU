# DRAFT — Work in Progress

## Purpose

JT files in draft status. These are preliminary designs, work in progress, and files not yet formally released.

## What to Store

- Initial design exports
- Work in progress models
- Preliminary assemblies
- Review drafts
- Iteration studies

## Characteristics

- **Status**: Not released
- **Approval**: Not formally approved
- **Use**: Internal review only
- **Change control**: Flexible, frequent changes
- **Distribution**: Limited to design team

## Usage

Use draft files for:
- Internal design iterations
- Preliminary reviews
- Concept exploration
- Trade studies
- Initial stakeholder feedback

## Workflow

1. Create initial JT exports → DRAFT
2. Iterate and revise
3. Conduct internal reviews
4. Final validation
5. Move to RELEASED upon approval

## Best Practices

- Clearly mark files as DRAFT
- Use draft watermarks if possible
- Limit distribution to design team
- Document iteration purpose
- Move to RELEASED when approved
- Archive drafts for design history
