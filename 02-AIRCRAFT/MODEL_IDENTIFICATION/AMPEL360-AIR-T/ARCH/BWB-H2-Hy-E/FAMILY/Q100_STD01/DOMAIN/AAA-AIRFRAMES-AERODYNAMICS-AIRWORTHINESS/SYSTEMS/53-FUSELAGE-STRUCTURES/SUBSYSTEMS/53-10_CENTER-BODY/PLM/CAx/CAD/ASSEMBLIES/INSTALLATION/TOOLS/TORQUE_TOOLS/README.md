## Tool Documentation

Each torque tool should include:
- Tool identification number
- Torque range and accuracy
- Type and model number
- Serial number
- Calibration certificate
- Calibration due date
- Operating instructions
- Maintenance requirements
- Traceability documentation

## Calibration Requirements

### Calibration Schedule
- Frequency: Every 3-12 months (depending on usage)
- After any impact or overload
- When accuracy is in question
- Per manufacturer recommendations
- Regulatory requirements

### Calibration Standards
- Traceable to NIST or equivalent
- Accuracy: ±4% or better
- Multiple points across range
- Documented procedures
- Certified calibration lab

### Calibration Documentation
- Calibration certificate
- Before and after readings
- As-found and as-left condition
- Adjustments performed
- Technician identification
- Next due date

## Tool Selection Guidelines

### Torque Range Selection
- Select tool with target torque in middle 20-80% of range
- Never exceed tool capacity
- Consider multiplication factors
- Account for adapter length corrections
- Verify angle requirements

### Tool Accuracy Requirements
- Standard applications: ±4%
- Critical applications: ±2%
- Verify capability before use
- Document actual tool used

### Environmental Considerations
- Temperature effects on accuracy
- Humidity and corrosion
- Contamination concerns
- Storage conditions

## Operating Procedures

### Pre-Use Checks
- Verify calibration is current
- Visual inspection for damage
- Check serial number matches record
- Verify proper accessories
- Confirm correct range

### During Use
- Apply torque smoothly
- Maintain proper angle
- Use correct technique
- Monitor for anomalies
- Record as-installed torque

### Post-Use
- Clean and store properly
- Return to tool crib
- Report any issues
- Document usage

## Torque Technique

### Proper Application
- Pull, don't push (when possible)
- Apply force perpendicular to wrench
- Avoid side loads
- Use smooth, steady motion
- Read at 90° to wrench

### Common Errors to Avoid
- Over-torquing
- Under-torquing
- Rapid impact loading
- Using damaged tools
- Incorrect adapter compensation
- Poor angle technique
