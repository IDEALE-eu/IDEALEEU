## Overview

This directory contains all Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) artifacts for the ATA-53-10 Center Body system.

## Purpose

PLM artifacts support the complete lifecycle:
- Design and development
- Analysis and validation
- Manufacturing and production
- Service and maintenance
- Optimization and updates

## Organization

PLM is organized by Computer-Aided tools (CAx):

### [CAx/](./CAx/) - Computer-Aided Engineering Tools

All computer-aided engineering artifacts are organized by tool category.

## Data Management

### Formats
- **Native**: Tool-specific formats (e.g., CATIA, STEP, NASTRAN)
- **Neutral**: Industry-standard exchange formats (STEP, IGES, STL)
- **Lightweight**: Visualization formats (JT, 3D PDF, glTF)

### Version Control
