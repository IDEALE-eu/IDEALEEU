# FRAMES — Structural Framework Systems

## Purpose

This directory contains the structural framework and support systems that form the foundation of the jig assembly.

## Contents

### Subdirectories

- **[BASE/](./BASE/)** — Base frame structures and foundation plates
- **[SUBFRAMES/](./SUBFRAMES/)** — Secondary support frames and structures

## Frame Types

### Base Frames
- Main structural frame
- Foundation plates
- Leveling systems
- Anchor points
- Transport/lifting provisions

### Subframes
- Upper support structures
- Side support frames
- Adjustable support structures
- Modular frame sections

## Design Requirements

All frames should:
- Provide rigid support structure
- Maintain dimensional stability
- Include leveling provisions (±0.5mm)
- Be designed for required load capacity
- Allow access for operations
- Include mounting provisions for locators and clamps
- Be marked with identification and orientation

## Materials

Typical materials:
- Structural steel (welded construction)
- Aluminum extrusions (modular systems)
- Cast iron (heavy-duty bases)

## Documentation

Each frame should include:
- Structural analysis and load calculations
- Material specifications
- Welding procedures
- Surface treatment specifications
- Assembly instructions
