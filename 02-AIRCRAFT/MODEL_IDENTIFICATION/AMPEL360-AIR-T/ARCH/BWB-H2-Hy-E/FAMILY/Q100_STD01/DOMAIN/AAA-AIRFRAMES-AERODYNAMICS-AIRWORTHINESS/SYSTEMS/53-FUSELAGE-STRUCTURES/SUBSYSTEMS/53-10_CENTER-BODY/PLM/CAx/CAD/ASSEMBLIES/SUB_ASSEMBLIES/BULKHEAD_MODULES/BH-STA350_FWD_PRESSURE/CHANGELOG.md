# Changelog - BH-STA350 Forward Pressure Bulkhead

## [Revision 01] - 2024-01-15

### Added
- Initial bulkhead module layout
- Master assembly structure with skeleton and environment
- Panel component (AL-2024-T3, 3mm thickness)
- Gusset reinforcements (AL-7075-T6)
- Coordinate system definition (A/C_ORIGIN, BH_STA350_CS)
- Datum planes (FS 350, BL 0, WL 0)
- Frame attachment hole patterns (10 holes)
- IFC exports (STEP, JT, 3D PDF)

### Design Details
- Location: Fuselage Station 350 (forward pressure bulkhead)
- Type: Pressure containment bulkhead
- Design pressure: 8.5 psi differential
- Material: Primary AL-2024-T3, reinforcements AL-7075-T6

### Status
- Current status: Draft
- Pending reviews: Structural analysis, pressure test validation
- Next steps: Complete detailed design, finalize hole patterns

### Notes
- First layout for review
- Preliminary geometry only
- Interface definitions in progress

# Changelog - BH-STA350 Forward Pressure Bulkhead

## [Revision 02] - 2025-10-21

### Updated
- Frame designation refined from "Frame C" to **Frame C0**
- Bulkhead reclassified as **compartment boundary** between pressurized fuselage and radome sensor bay
- Added **sensor payload context**: radar AESA, GNSS, SATCOM
- Integrated **firewall layer** (partial coverage, titanium + EMI mesh)
- Geometry optimized topologically: radial ribs, hexagonal lightening cutouts, reinforced hole collars
- Updated coordinate system and datum logic for modular relocation
- YAML configuration updated to reflect new context, firewall spec, and validation badges

### Added
- `firewall_layer` component (53-10-BH-STA350_FIREWALL.prt)
- `sensor_payload` context block in configuration
- `COMPARTMENT_BOUNDARY_VERIFIED` and `FIREWALL_COMPLIANT` badges
- Snapshot comparison: original vs. optimized bulkhead geometry
- Full fuselage profile visualization with FS markers and Frame C0 installation

### Design Details
- Location: Fuselage Station 350 (Frame C0)
- Type: Pressure containment + sensor interface + firewall boundary
- Design pressure: 8.5 psi differential
- Material: Primary AL-2024-T3, reinforcements AL-7075-T6, firewall titanium foil
- Sensor integration: high thermal dissipation, elevated EMI risk

### Status
- Current status: In validation
- Pending reviews: EMI shielding compliance, thermal dissipation modeling
- Next steps: Finalize firewall geometry, validate sensor interface, issue full IFC export

### Notes
- Geometry now reflects operational context and multisystem integration
- Validated against CS-25.867 and DO-160G (Sections 20, 23)
- Ready for HUELLÎ” registry entry and badge issuance
