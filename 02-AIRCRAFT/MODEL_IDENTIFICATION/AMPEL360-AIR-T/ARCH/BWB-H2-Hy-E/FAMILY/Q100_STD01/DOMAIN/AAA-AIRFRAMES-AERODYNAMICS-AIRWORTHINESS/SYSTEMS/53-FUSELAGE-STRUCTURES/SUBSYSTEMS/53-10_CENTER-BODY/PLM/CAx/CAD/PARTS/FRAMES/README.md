# FRAMES — Fuselage Frame Parts

## Purpose

This directory contains CAD part files for fuselage frames used in the 53-10 Center Body subsystem. Frames are ring-shaped structural members that provide cross-sectional rigidity, maintain fuselage shape, and transfer loads between stringers and skin panels.

## Component Description

### Frame Types
- **Circumferential frames**: Complete ring frames encircling the fuselage
- **Partial frames**: Segmented frames for specific zones or openings
- **Heavy frames**: Reinforced frames at major load introduction points
- **Light frames**: Standard frames for distributed load support
- **Door frames**: Reinforced frames surrounding door openings
- **Floor support frames**: Frames with floor beam attachment provisions

## Naming Convention

```
53-10_FRAME_<frame-id>_<location>_<version>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- `53-10_FRAME_F01_FWD_v01.CATPart` — Forward frame F01
- `53-10_FRAME_F05_CENTER_v02.prt` — Center frame F05
- `53-10_FRAME_F12_WING-ATTACHMENT_v01.sldprt` — Wing attachment frame F12

## Design Considerations

### Structural Requirements
- Maintain fuselage cross-sectional shape under pressure and flight loads
- Provide attachment points for stringers, skin panels, and floors
- Transfer concentrated loads from wings, landing gear, or engines
- Support door and window cutouts with local reinforcement

### Material Specifications
- **Primary material**: Aluminum alloy 2024-T3 or 7075-T6
- **Alternative**: Titanium Ti-6Al-4V for high-temperature zones
- **Composite**: Carbon fiber reinforced polymer for weight optimization

### Manufacturing Methods
- **Machined**: CNC machined from plate or extrusion
- **Formed**: Roll-formed from sheet with welded or bonded joints
- **Built-up**: Assembled from multiple segments
- **Additive**: 3D printed for complex geometries

## File Organization

Store frame parts with clear identification:
- Frame station number (F01, F02, etc.)
- Location descriptor (FWD, CENTER, AFT)
- Configuration variant (if applicable)

## Cross-References

- **Frame assemblies**: [`../../ASSEMBLIES/`](../../ASSEMBLIES/)
- **Stringer attachments**: [`../STRINGERS/`](../STRINGERS/)
- **Skin panel interfaces**: [`../SKIN_PANELS/`](../SKIN_PANELS/)
- **Floor beam connections**: [`../FLOORS/`](../FLOORS/)
- **Detail drawings**: [`../../DRAWINGS/`](../../DRAWINGS/)

## Quality Requirements

Frame parts must meet:
- Dimensional tolerances per drawing specifications
- Surface finish requirements for fatigue resistance
- Material properties per applicable material specifications
- Inspection requirements per AS9100
