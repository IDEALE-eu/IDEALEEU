# 56-00 STANDARDS_GENERAL — Windows (BWB-H2-Hy-E, Q100)

**Purpose**: Common rules, standards, and policies for all ATA-56 subsystems: optical requirements, structural design criteria, heating/anti-ice strategies, health monitoring approach, and verification standards.

## Scope
- Window design classes (cockpit windshields, side windows, cabin windows)
- Structural requirements: load factors, bird strike, pressurization, thermal
- Optical quality standards: distortion limits, clarity, scratch resistance
- Heating/anti-ice strategies: element types, control logic, temperature limits
- Health monitoring approach: delamination detection, crack monitoring, lifecycle tracking
- Material selection criteria: glass types, interlayers, coatings
- Sealing and gasket standards: leak rates, environmental resistance
- Interfaces to structural (52, 53) and systems (24, 30, 31, 42, 92, 93)

## Deliverables
- `WINDOW_DESIGN_STANDARDS.md` — design classes, load cases, factors of safety
- `OPTICAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` — visibility, distortion, transmittance, scratch limits
- `HEATING_ANTIICE_POLICY.md` — element types, control philosophy, thermal limits
- `HEALTH_MONITORING_STRATEGY.md` — sensor types, detection methods, lifecycle tracking
- `MATERIALS_ALLOWABLES.md` — approved materials, suppliers, test data references
- `SEALING_GASKET_SPECS.md` — seal types, compression loads, leak rate targets
- `INTERFACE_CONTROL_PLAN.md` — coordination with ATA-24, 30, 31, 42, 52, 53, 92, 93
- `VERIFICATION_MATRIX.csv` — trace to tests, analysis, and certification evidence

## Interfaces
See `../../INTERFACE_MATRIX/AAA↔24_30_31_42_52_53_92_93.csv` for detailed system interfaces:
- **24 Electrical** (power for heating, bonding/grounding)
- **30 Ice/Rain Protection** (anti-ice coordination)
- **31 Indicating/Recording** (health monitoring, status)
- **42 IMA** (sensor data integration)
- **52 Doors**, **53 Fuselage** (structural interfaces)
- **92 EWIS** (wiring for heating/sensors)
- **93 HUMS** (health and usage monitoring)

## Acceptance Criteria
- All 56-x subsystems conform to design standards in `WINDOW_DESIGN_STANDARDS.md`
- Optical quality meets requirements in `OPTICAL_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- Materials referenced exist in `MATERIALS_ALLOWABLES.md` with test data
- Heating/anti-ice systems comply with `HEATING_ANTIICE_POLICY.md`
- Health monitoring sensors implement strategy per `HEALTH_MONITORING_STRATEGY.md`
- All interfaces validated per `INTERFACE_CONTROL_PLAN.md`
- Verification evidence linked in `VERIFICATION_MATRIX.csv`
