# INSTALLATION â€” Installation Drawings

## Purpose

This directory contains installation drawings that define how the 53-10 Center Body subsystem interfaces with and installs into adjacent systems and the overall aircraft.

## What to Store

### Installation Drawing Types
- **Interface control**: Boundary definitions with adjacent systems
- **Installation procedures**: Step-by-step installation sequences
- **Tooling requirements**: Special tools, jigs, and fixtures needed
- **Access requirements**: Clearances, access panels, maintenance provisions
- **Mating interfaces**: Wing-to-body, nose-to-center body, aft-to-center body
- **System installations**: Equipment, systems, and components mounted to structure

## Content Requirements

### Mandatory Information
- **Interface datums**: Reference coordinate systems and stations
- **Mating dimensions**: Critical dimensions for proper fit
- **Installation sequence**: Step-by-step procedure with notes
- **Fastener specifications**: Types, quantities, and installation specs
- **Torque requirements**: Torque values for all fasteners
- **Clearance requirements**: Minimum clearances for tools and access
- **Alignment procedures**: Methods to achieve proper alignment
- **Inspection criteria**: Acceptance criteria and inspection points

## Naming Convention

## Interface Types

### Structural Interfaces
- **Wing attachment**: Wing-to-body carry-through structure
- **Nose section**: Forward fuselage interface
- **Aft fuselage**: Aft center body to rear fuselage
- **Keel beam**: Lower fuselage structural continuity
- **Floor structure**: Cabin floor beam attachments

### System Interfaces
- **Landing gear**: Main landing gear bay installations
- **Fuel systems**: Fuel tank installations and connections
- **Hydraulic systems**: Hydraulic line routings and supports
- **Electrical systems**: Wire harness routings and supports
- **Environmental control**: ECS ducting and equipment mounts

## Organization

Organize installation drawings by:
- **Interface location**: Wing, nose, aft, floor, systems
- **Installation type**: Primary structure, secondary structure, systems
- **System**: ATA chapter (e.g., 32-Landing Gear, 28-Fuel)

## Best Practices

### Interface Definition
- Define clear datum reference systems
- Show mating part interface in phantom or outline
- Dimension all critical interface features
- Include tolerance stack-up analysis if critical
- Show both sides of interface (this assembly and mating)

### Installation Sequence
- Number installation steps sequentially
- Show intermediate states if helpful
- Highlight critical alignment steps
- Note required tooling for each step
- Include safety precautions and warnings

### Clearance and Access
- Show minimum clearance envelopes
- Identify access requirements for installation
- Note required access panels or openings
- Document removal/installation of temporary items
- Show tool access and swing radius

### Quality Control
- Define inspection points in sequence
- Specify acceptance criteria for each step
- Note dimensional verification requirements
- Include torque verification steps
- Document functional checks
