# PPP-PNEUMATIC-POWER-SYSTEMS Domain

**Architecture:** BWB-H2-Hy-E • **Family:** Q100_STD01

## Purpose

This domain manages pneumatic power systems and related components, including fuel system integration (ATA-28) for the pilot system.

## Structure

- `SYSTEMS/` - Contains ATA chapters and their systems
  - Each system follows the TFA structure with PLM/CAx and CONF/BASELINE hierarchies

## ATA Chapters

- **ATA-28** - Fuel System (including H₂)

## Integration

This domain integrates with:
- PPP-PROPULSION-FUEL-SYSTEMS (fuel systems)
- MEC-MECHANICAL-SYSTEMS-MODULES (pneumatic systems)
- EEE-ELECTRICAL-ENDOTRANSPONDERS-CIRCULATION (power distribution)

## Rules

- Follow TFA structure for all artifacts
- Maintain traceability through metadata files
- Use make commands for structure management
