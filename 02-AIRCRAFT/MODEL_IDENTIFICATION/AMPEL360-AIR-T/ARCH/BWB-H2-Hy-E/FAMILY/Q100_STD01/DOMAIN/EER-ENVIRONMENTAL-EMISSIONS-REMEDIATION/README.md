```
ATA-{XX}/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SYSTEMS/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ATA-{XX}-{YY}/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PLM/              # Product Lifecycle Management
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CAx/          # Computer-Aided tools
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CONF/             # Configuration management
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BASELINE/
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ COMPONENTS/
```

## Traceability

All systems maintain traceability to:
- System requirements
- Interface control documents (ICDs)
