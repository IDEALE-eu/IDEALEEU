## CAD Interference Checking

### DMU Analysis
- Complete assembly model
- All components in installed position
- Worst-case tolerance conditions
- Deflection envelopes
- Thermal expansion allowances

### Clash Detection Settings
- Hard interference: Zero clearance
- Soft interference: Minimum clearance zones
- Clearance analysis: Specified minimum distances
- Component groups and exclusions
- Check frequency during design

### Interference Report Contents
- Interference location
- Components involved
- Interference volume/depth
- Clearance violation amount
- Severity classification
- Recommended resolution
- Status tracking

## Physical Interference Checking

### Installation Phase Checks
- Pre-installation fit check
- Progressive installation verification
- Temporary support clearances
- Tool clearance verification
- Final as-installed check

### Measurement Methods
- Visual inspection
- Feeler gauge measurement
- Gap measurement tools
- Borescope inspection
- Clearance verification fixtures

### Documentation
- Inspection location
- Measured clearance
- Acceptance criteria
- Pass/fail determination
- Inspector and date
- Photographic evidence

## Interference Classification

### Critical Interference (Class 1)
- Hard interference (physical contact)
- Safety-critical clearance violations
- Structural stress/damage risk
- Functional impairment
- **Action Required:** Must be resolved before proceeding

### Major Interference (Class 2)
- Soft interference (insufficient clearance)
- Maintenance access restriction
- Tool clearance issues
- Non-critical clearance violations
- **Action Required:** Resolution required, may proceed with engineering approval

### Minor Interference (Class 3)
- Clearance preference violations
- Non-critical access restrictions
- Appearance issues
- **Action Required:** Document and track, resolution recommended

## Resolution Process

### Issue Identification
- Interference detected
- Classification assigned
- Impact assessment
- Stakeholder notification

### Root Cause Analysis
- Design error
- Manufacturing variation
- Assembly error
- Tolerance stack-up
- Procedure issue

### Resolution Options
- Design modification
- Part rework/adjustment
- Assembly sequence change
- Tolerance relaxation (with approval)
- Waiver/deviation (with approval)

### Resolution Verification
- Re-check after correction
- Document resolution
- Update procedures/drawings
- Lessons learned capture

## Interference Tracking

### Issue Log
- Issue identification number
- Discovery date
- Components involved
- Interference type and magnitude
- Classification
- Assigned responsibility
- Target resolution date
- Status (open, in-work, resolved, closed)

### Metrics
- Number of interferences by type
- Time to resolution
- Root cause distribution
- Trend analysis
- Process improvement opportunities

## Prevention Strategies

### Design Phase
- Comprehensive DMU analysis
- Multi-discipline design reviews
- Clearance standards enforcement
- Worst-case tolerance analysis
- Early prototype verification

### Installation Phase
