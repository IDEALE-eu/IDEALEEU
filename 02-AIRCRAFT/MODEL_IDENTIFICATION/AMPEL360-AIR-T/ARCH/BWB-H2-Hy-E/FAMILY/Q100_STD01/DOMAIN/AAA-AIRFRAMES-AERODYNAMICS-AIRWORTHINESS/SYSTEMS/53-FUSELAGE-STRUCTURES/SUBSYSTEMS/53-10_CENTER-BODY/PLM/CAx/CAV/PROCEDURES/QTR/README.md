# QTR — Qualification Test Reports

## Purpose

Qualification Test Reports (QTR) document the execution and results of qualification tests, providing evidence of compliance with certification requirements.

## Report Structure

Each QTR follows the standard format:

### 1. Executive Summary
- Test objectives
- Key results
- Compliance statement
- Recommendations

### 2. Test Configuration
- Test article description and configuration
- Modifications from baseline
- Material certifications
- As-tested condition

### 3. Test Setup
- Test facility description
- Equipment and instrumentation
- Calibration records
- Test rig configuration
- Photographs of setup

### 4. Test Execution
- Procedure followed (reference to QTP)
- Date and time of test
- Test personnel
- Deviations from procedure
- Anomalies and resolutions
- Witness points and signatures

### 5. Test Results
- Raw data summary
- Processed data and analysis
- Comparison to predictions (FEA/CFD)
- Pass/fail assessment against criteria
- Graphs, plots, and data visualizations

### 6. Data Quality
- Instrumentation performance
- Data completeness
- Calibration verification
- Measurement uncertainty

### 7. Correlation
- Comparison to analytical predictions
- Discussion of differences
- Model validation or tuning recommendations

### 8. Observations and Findings
- Visual observations
- Post-test inspection results
- Damage or permanent deformation
- Unexpected behavior

### 9. Compliance Statement
- Requirement-by-requirement compliance verification
- References to acceptance criteria
- Certification authority concurrence

### 10. Conclusions and Recommendations
- Summary of compliance demonstration
- Recommendations for design or analysis
- Follow-up actions required

### Appendices
- Complete data sets
- Detailed graphs and charts
- Photographs
- Inspection reports
- Certifications and calibrations

## Report Numbering

Format: `QTR-53-10-[QTP#]-[REV]`

Example: `QTR-53-10-100-A` for QTP-53-10-100 Revision A results

## Approval Chain

1. **Test Engineer** — Data review and initial report preparation
2. **Independent Reviewer** — Technical review and verification
3. **Test Engineering Lead** — Approval of report content
4. **Chief Engineer** — Approval of compliance statement
5. **Quality Assurance** — Report quality and traceability verification
6. **Certification Authority** — Acceptance for certification credit (as needed)

## Data Archival

- Reports stored in both `QTR/` and `../../REPORTS/TEST_REPORTS/`
- Raw data archived in `../../DATA/RAW/[TEST_ID]/`
- Processed data in `../../DATA/PROCESSED/[TEST_ID]/`
- Metadata in `../../DATA/METADATA/[TEST_ID]/`
