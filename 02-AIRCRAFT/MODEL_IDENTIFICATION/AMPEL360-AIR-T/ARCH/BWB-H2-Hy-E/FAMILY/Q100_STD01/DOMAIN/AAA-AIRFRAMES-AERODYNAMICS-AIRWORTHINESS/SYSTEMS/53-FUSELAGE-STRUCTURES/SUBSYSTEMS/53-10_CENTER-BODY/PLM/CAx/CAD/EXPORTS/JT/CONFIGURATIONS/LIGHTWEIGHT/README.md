# LIGHTWEIGHT — Performance-Optimized Configurations

## Purpose

JT files optimized for maximum performance and fast loading. These configurations prioritize file size and rendering speed over geometric detail.

## What to Store

- Performance-optimized models
- Minimal file size versions
- Fast-loading configurations
- Web/mobile-ready models

## Optimization Approach

- High compression settings
- Low polygon tessellation
- Minimal metadata
- Optimized hierarchy
- Reduced texture/appearance data

## Usage

Use lightweight configurations for:
- Web-based viewers
- Mobile device viewing
- Large assembly contexts
- Slow network environments
- PLM web interface
- Quick reference viewing
- Stakeholder portals

## Characteristics

- **File size**: Minimum possible
- **Load time**: Fastest
- **Visual quality**: Acceptable for purpose
- **Detail level**: Sufficient for recognition
- **Performance**: Optimized for all platforms
