# System 56: WINDOWS

## Overview

The ATA-56 Windows system encompasses all aircraft windows including cockpit windshields, side windows, and cabin passenger windows, along with their associated frames, seals, heating/anti-ice systems, and health monitoring sensors.

## System Scope

This system covers:
- Cockpit windshields and panels
- Cockpit side windows
- Cabin windows and assemblies
- Heating, anti-ice, and defog systems
- Frames, seals, and gaskets
- Scratch panes, shades, and blinds
- Health monitoring and delamination sensors
- Repair kits and maintenance tools
- Installation and training procedures

## System Interfaces

See [Interface Matrix](./INTERFACE_MATRIX/) directory for detailed CSV files defining interfaces with other systems:

### Structural Interfaces
- **52 Doors**: Frame interfaces, sealing coordination
- **53 Fuselage Structure**: Window cutouts, mounting provisions, load paths

### Systems Interfaces
- **24 Electrical**: Power supply for heating elements, bonding/grounding
- **30 Ice and Rain Protection**: Anti-ice and defog system coordination
- **31 Indicating/Recording**: Window health monitoring, status indication
- **42 IMA**: Sensor data integration, health monitoring systems
- **92 EWIS**: Wiring harnesses for heating and sensors
- **93 HUMS**: Health and usage monitoring system integration

## Key Design Considerations

### Safety Critical
- **Structural integrity**: Windshields and windows must withstand operational loads, pressurization, bird strike
- **Optical quality**: Clear vision requirements for cockpit windows
- **Fail-safe design**: Multiple panes with damage tolerance
- **Emergency egress**: Cabin windows must meet evacuation requirements

### Performance Critical
- **Heating effectiveness**: Anti-ice and defog must maintain clear vision
- **Seal integrity**: Leak rate must meet pressurization requirements
- **Optical clarity**: Minimize distortion and scratches
- **Delamination detection**: Early detection of window degradation

### Operational
- **Maintenance access**: Ease of inspection and replacement
- **Weight optimization**: Balance between strength and weight
- **Reliability**: MTBF targets for heating and sensor systems
- **Standardization**: Commonality across window types where practical

## Subsystems

All subsystems are located in the [SUBSYSTEMS/](./SUBSYSTEMS/) directory. Each subsystem contains:
- README.md with detailed documentation
- PLM/CAx/ with engineering artifacts (CAD, CAE, CAO, CAM, CAI, CAV, CAP, CAS, CMP)
- PLM/EBOM_LINKS.md for BOM references (where applicable)
- META.json and inherit.json for configuration

## Working with This System

### System Engineers
1. Review [INTEGRATION_VIEW.md](./INTEGRATION_VIEW.md) for system scope and integration strategy
2. Check [INTERFACE_MATRIX/](./INTERFACE_MATRIX/) for interfaces with other systems
3. Navigate to specific subsystems in [SUBSYSTEMS/](./SUBSYSTEMS/)

### Subsystem Engineers
1. Access your subsystem directory under `SUBSYSTEMS/`
2. Review subsystem README for specific requirements
3. Place engineering artifacts in `PLM/CAx/` subdirectories
4. Update `PLM/EBOM_LINKS.md` for BOM references where applicable

### Configuration Management
- Interface definitions in `INTERFACE_MATRIX/*.csv`
- Engineering BOMs in `SUBSYSTEMS/*/PLM/EBOM_LINKS.md`
- CAx artifacts in `SUBSYSTEMS/*/PLM/CAx/*`
- Changes via ECR/ECO per `00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/`

## Compliance & Certification

Window systems must comply with:
- CS-25 / FAR 25 Subpart D (Design and Construction)
- CS-25.773 / FAR 25.773 (Pilot compartment view)
- CS-25.775 / FAR 25.775 (Windshields and windows)
- Bird strike requirements per CS-25.631 / FAR 25.631
- Emergency lighting and marking requirements
