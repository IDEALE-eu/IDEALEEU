# TRACEABILITY — Requirements and Artifact Traceability

## Purpose

This directory maintains comprehensive traceability between requirements, test cases, test results, and deliverable artifacts for the 53-10 CENTER-BODY subsystem validation program.

## Directory Structure

### REQ2TEST/
Requirements-to-test traceability matrices mapping each requirement to the tests that verify it.

**Contents**:
- Traceability matrices (requirement → test)
- Coverage analysis reports
- Gap analysis (untested requirements)
- Verification cross-reference matrix (VCRM)

**File Format**: `REQ2TEST_[DOMAIN]_[DATE].xlsx`

**Matrix Columns**:
- Requirement ID
- Requirement text
- Verification method (test, analysis, inspection, demonstration)
- Test ID(s)
- Test procedure reference
- Test report reference
- Verification status
- Comments/notes

### TEST2ARTIFACT/
Test-to-artifact traceability mapping test results to deliverable artifacts and certification evidence.

**Contents**:
- Test artifacts index
- Certification evidence mapping
- Deliverable traceability
- Data package index

**File Format**: `TEST2ARTIFACT_[DATE].xlsx`

**Matrix Columns**:
- Test ID
- Test date
- Test article S/N
- Data location
- Test report reference
- Certification package reference
- Deliverable document
- Archive location

## Traceability Process

### Requirements-to-Test (REQ2TEST)

1. **Requirements Allocation**
   - Decompose high-level requirements to subsystem level
   - Assign requirements to 53-10 CENTER-BODY
   - Document in requirements database

2. **Verification Planning**
   - Define verification method for each requirement
   - Identify test procedures needed
   - Create preliminary traceability matrix

3. **Test Execution**
   - Execute tests per procedures
   - Link test results to requirements
   - Update verification status

4. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Verify all requirements have verification method
   - Identify gaps in test coverage
   - Plan additional tests if needed

5. **Compliance Review**
   - Review verification evidence
   - Confirm requirements satisfaction
   - Document compliance

### Test-to-Artifact (TEST2ARTIFACT)

1. **Test Execution**
   - Conduct tests per procedures
   - Collect data and generate reports

2. **Artifact Generation**
   - Create test reports
   - Compile certification packages
   - Prepare deliverable documents

3. **Traceability Mapping**
   - Link tests to artifacts
   - Document data locations
   - Create artifact index

4. **Archive and Retrieval**
   - Archive artifacts in repository
   - Maintain retrieval index
   - Ensure long-term accessibility

## Traceability Tools

- **Requirements Management**: DOORS, Jama, or similar
- **Test Management**: TestRail, qTest, or similar
- **Document Management**: PLM system, SharePoint, or Git repository
- **Traceability Reports**: Automated extraction from management tools

## Verification Status Codes

- **PLANNED** — Verification method defined, not executed
- **IN-WORK** — Test in progress
- **COMPLETE** — Test executed, results documented
- **VERIFIED** — Requirement verified by test/analysis
- **DEFERRED** — Verification deferred to later phase
- **WAIVED** — Requirement waived or not applicable

## Compliance Verification

For certification, demonstrate:
- **Completeness** — All requirements have verification method
- **Correctness** — Verification methods appropriate for requirements
- **Evidence** — Verification evidence documented and retrievable
- **Traceability** — Bidirectional traceability maintained
- **Configuration** — Test article configuration controlled

## Traceability Audit

Periodic audits verify:
- Traceability matrices are current
- All requirements traced to tests
- All tests traced to requirements
- Evidence is accessible and complete
- No orphan requirements or tests

**Audit Frequency**: Quarterly or before certification milestones

## Reporting

### Coverage Reports
- Requirements verification coverage percentage
- Verification methods distribution (test vs. analysis vs. etc.)
- Gaps and open items

### Status Reports
- Verification status by requirement
- Test execution status
- Outstanding actions

### Certification Reports
- Compliance verification summary
- Evidence packages index
- Certification readiness assessment
