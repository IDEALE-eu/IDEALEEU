## Usage Guidelines

1. **Test Planning**: Begin with PLAN/ to define test objectives, scope, and resources
2. **Requirements**: Link tests to requirements in REQUIREMENTS_LINKS/
3. **Procedures**: Develop detailed test procedures in PROCEDURES/
4. **Execution**: Execute tests and store results in TEST_CAMPAIGNS/
5. **Data Management**: Store raw data in DATA/RAW/, processed results in DATA/PROCESSED/
6. **Reporting**: Document results in REPORTS/
7. **Correlation**: Perform test-to-analysis correlation in CORRELATION/
8. **Compliance**: Compile compliance evidence in COMPLIANCE/
9. **Issues**: Track and resolve issues in ISSUES/

## Data Storage

- Store large binary files (test data, videos) via Git LFS
- Include metadata files describing test conditions and configurations
- Maintain data integrity with checksums and version control
- Archive completed test campaigns with full traceability

## Change Control

Changes to test configurations, procedures, or baselines require:
- Test Engineering approval
- Configuration Control Board (CCB) review for baseline changes
- Update to traceability matrices in TRACEABILITY/
- Documentation in CONFIG/BASELINES/
