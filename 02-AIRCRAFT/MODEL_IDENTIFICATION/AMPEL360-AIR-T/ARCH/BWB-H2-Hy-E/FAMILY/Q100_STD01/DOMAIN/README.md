# Domain Organization Overview

## Introduction

The Q100_STD01 family configuration organizes aircraft systems into **15 engineering domains** based on functional responsibility. This structure ensures clear ownership, efficient collaboration, and proper interface management.

## Domain Structure

Each domain follows this organizational structure:

```

## ATA-to-Domain Mapping

The complete mapping of all 100 ATA chapters to domains is provided in:
**[ATA_DOMAIN_MAPPING.csv](./ATA_DOMAIN_MAPPING.csv)**

This CSV file includes:
- ATA chapter number (01-100)
- ATA chapter name
- Primary domain responsible
- Secondary domains involved (if any)
- Implementation notes

## Key Principles

### 1. Primary Domain Responsibility
Each ATA chapter has ONE primary domain responsible for:
- System architecture and design
- Requirements management
- Integration with other systems
- Certification and compliance

### 2. Secondary Domain Involvement
Secondary domains provide:
- Interface support
- Subsystem components
- Technical expertise
- Integration coordination

### 3. Special Cases

#### ATA-92 (EWIS - Wiring)
- **AUTHORITATIVE domain: EEE**
- ALL electrical wiring must be documented in ATA-92
- Regardless of which system the wiring serves
- This ensures centralized wire harness management

#### ATA-28 (Fuel including H₂)
- **Primary domain: PPP**
- Close coordination with **CQH** for cryogenic aspects
- Hydrogen storage tanks managed by CQH (ATA-47)
- Fuel distribution and management by PPP (ATA-28)

#### Reserved Chapters (OOO domain)
- Chapters 17-19: Propeller (if not applicable)
- Chapters 58-59: Spacecraft docking/robotics
- Chapters 68-69: Rotorcraft (if not applicable)
- Chapters 86-87: Spacecraft (planetary protection, radiation)
- Chapters 88-90: Spacecraft (reserved, space traffic)
- Chapters 95-99: Reserved for future use
- Chapter 100: Repository meta templates

## Cross-Domain Collaboration

### Interface Management
- Interface Control Documents (ICDs) define boundaries
- RASCI matrices clarify responsibilities
- Regular interface reviews ensure alignment

### System Integration
- Integration views document system interactions
- Interface matrices track all connections
- Domain coordinators facilitate collaboration

### Change Management
- Configuration Control Board (CCB) reviews changes
- Cross-domain impact assessments required
- Traceability maintained throughout
