# REPORTS â€” CMM Measurement Reports

## Purpose

This directory contains measurement reports generated from CMM inspection operations.

## Contents

### Report Types
- **Inspection reports**: Detailed measurement results
- **Summary reports**: Pass/fail summary with key dimensions
- **Trend reports**: Historical measurement data
- **Non-conformance reports**: Out-of-tolerance findings

## Naming Convention

Use the following pattern:
```
CMM_REPORT_<part-id>_<serial>_<date>.pdf
```

Examples:
- `CMM_REPORT_FRAME-F05_S001_2024-01-15.pdf`
- `CMM_REPORT_WING-INTERFACE_S002_2024-02-20.pdf`
- `CMM_REPORT_SKIN-PANEL-001_S003_2024-03-10.pdf`

## Report Contents

Each report should include:
- **Header**: Part ID, serial number, date, operator
- **Measurement summary**: Pass/fail status
- **Dimensional results**: Measured values vs. tolerances
- **GD&T results**: Geometric tolerances
- **Statistical data**: Cp, Cpk values if applicable
- **Graphical representations**: Deviation plots
- **Sign-off**: Inspector and engineer approval
