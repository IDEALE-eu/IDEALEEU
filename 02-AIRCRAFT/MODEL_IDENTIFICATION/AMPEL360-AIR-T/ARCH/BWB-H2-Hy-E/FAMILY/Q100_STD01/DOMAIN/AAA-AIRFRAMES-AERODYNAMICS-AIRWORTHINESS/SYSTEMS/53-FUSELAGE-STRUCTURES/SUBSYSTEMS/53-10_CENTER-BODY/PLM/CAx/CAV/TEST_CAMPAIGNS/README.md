# TEST_CAMPAIGNS — Test Campaign Organization

## Purpose

This directory organizes all test campaigns by category and type, providing a structured approach to validation testing of the 53-10 CENTER-BODY subsystem.

## Directory Structure

### GROUND/
Ground-based structural and environmental tests:
- **STATIC/** — Static strength tests (limit and ultimate loads)
- **FATIGUE/** — Fatigue and durability testing
- **VIBRATION/** — Vibration qualification per DO-160
- **PRESSURIZATION/** — Pressurization and pressure cycling
- **IMPACT/** — Impact damage resistance
- **CRYO/** — Cryogenic temperature testing for H₂ compatibility
- **FIRE/** — Fire resistance and burnthrough
- **LIGHTNING/** — Lightning strike testing

### SYSTEM/
System-level integration tests:
- **VENTING/** — Venting system functionality and performance
- **MOUNTING/** — Mounting interface verification and load transfer
- **ACCESS/** — Access panel and maintenance verification

### RIGS/
Test rig configurations and setups:
- **PRESSURE_RIG/** — Pressurization test rig
- **VENT_RIG/** — Venting system test rig
- **THERMAL_RIG/** — Thermal/cryogenic test rig

### INSTRUMENTATION/
Instrumentation setup, calibration, and data:
- **STRAIN_GAUGES/** — Strain measurement
- **DIC/** — Digital Image Correlation for full-field strain
- **ACCELEROMETERS/** — Vibration and acceleration measurement
- **THERMOCOUPLES/** — Temperature measurement
- **DAQ/** — Data acquisition system configuration

## Campaign Naming Convention

Format: `CAMPAIGN_[CATEGORY]_[TYPE]_[DATE]`

Examples:
- `CAMPAIGN_GROUND_STATIC_2025Q1`
- `CAMPAIGN_SYSTEM_VENTING_2025Q2`
- `CAMPAIGN_RIG_PRESSURE_2025Q3`

## Campaign Documentation

Each campaign directory should contain:
1. **Campaign Plan** — Objectives, scope, schedule
2. **Test Matrix** — List of tests to be executed
3. **Resource Plan** — Personnel, equipment, facilities
4. **Risk Assessment** — Campaign-specific risks
5. **Test Logs** — Daily execution logs
6. **Data Index** — Index to collected data
7. **Campaign Report** — Summary of results and findings

## Cross-References

- Test procedures: `../../PROCEDURES/`
- Test data: `../../DATA/`
- Test reports: `../../REPORTS/TEST_REPORTS/`
- Instrumentation calibration: `INSTRUMENTATION/[TYPE]/CALIBRATION/`

## Campaign Execution Workflow

1. **Planning** — Develop campaign plan and prepare resources
2. **Setup** — Install test article, rig, and instrumentation
3. **Calibration** — Calibrate all measurement systems
4. **Dry Run** — Execute test sequence without loading
5. **Execution** — Perform tests per procedures
6. **Data Review** — Quick-look data validation
7. **Teardown** — Remove instrumentation, inspect test article
8. **Reporting** — Compile campaign report
