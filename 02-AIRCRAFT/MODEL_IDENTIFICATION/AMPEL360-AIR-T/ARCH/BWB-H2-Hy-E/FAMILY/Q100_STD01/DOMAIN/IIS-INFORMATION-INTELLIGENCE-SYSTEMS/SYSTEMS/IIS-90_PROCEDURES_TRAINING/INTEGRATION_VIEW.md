# IIS-90_PROCEDURES_TRAINING — Integration View

## Functional Role

The Procedures & Training system provides comprehensive operational procedures, emergency checklists, and training materials for all aircraft systems. It serves as the central repository for standardized operational knowledge and crew competency development.

## System Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Emergency and abnormal procedures
- Checklists and Quick Reference Handbooks (QRH)
- Computer-Based Training (CBT) modules
- Training curriculum and materials
- Competency assessment frameworks

**Out of Scope:**
- Flight simulation execution (ATA 94 - Training Systems)
- Crew scheduling and planning (Operations)
- Maintenance execution (ATA 45)
- Real-time operational guidance (FMS, ATA 22)

## Key Dependencies

### Content Sources
- **All ATA Systems** — System-specific procedures and training requirements
- **46** — Information Systems: Content management and version control
- **91** — Charts & Performance: Performance procedures and limitations
- **45** — Central Maintenance System: Maintenance procedures

### Delivery Platforms
- **46-50** — OTA Software Content Management: Content distribution
- **46-20** — Data Bus UTCS Broker: Training data delivery
- **93** — Ground Support Equipment: Ground training stations
- **94** — Training Systems: Simulator integration

## Operational Modes

### Content Development Mode
- Procedure authoring and review
- Training module creation
- Content validation and approval
- Version control and change management

### Content Delivery Mode
- Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) integration
- Training station content synchronization
- OTA updates to crew devices
- Simulator content provisioning

### Assessment Mode
- Competency testing

## Interface Strategy

### Content Management
- Primary: 46-50 OTA Software Content Management system
- Format: S1000D for technical procedures
- Format: SCORM for CBT modules
- Distribution: Ground IT APIs (46-10)

### Integration Points
- **Electronic Flight Bags (EFB):** Procedure delivery to cockpit
- **Training Stations:** CBT module deployment
- **Ground Systems:** Procedure updates and synchronization
- **Simulators (ATA 94):** Training scenario integration
