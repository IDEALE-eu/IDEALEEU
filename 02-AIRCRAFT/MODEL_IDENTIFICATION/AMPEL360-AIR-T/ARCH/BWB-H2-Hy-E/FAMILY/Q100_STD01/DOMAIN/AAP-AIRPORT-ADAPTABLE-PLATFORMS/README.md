## Overview

This domain encompasses all systems related to:
- **Airport Operations**: Ground handling and airport interface
- **Adaptable Platforms**: Flexible operational configurations
- **Ground Support**: Airport-based support systems

## ATA Chapters

This domain includes the following ATA chapters as **Primary Domain**:

### Ground Operations
- **ATA-10**: Parking/Mooring *(To be added)*

## Scope

### Airport Operations
- Ground handling procedures
- Airport compatibility
- Parking and mooring systems
- Ground movement operations

### Adaptable Platforms
- Configurable systems
- Multi-role capability
- Operational flexibility

### Ground Support
- Airport-specific equipment interfaces
- Ground service connections
- Towing and positioning systems

## Key Standards

- **ICAO Annex 14**: Aerodromes
- **IATA Ground Operations Manual (IGOM)**
- **AS9100**: Quality management for aerospace
- **ATA Spec 100/iSpec 2200**: Maintenance documentation

## Interfaces

This domain interfaces with:
- **IIS**: Information systems for ground coordination
- **LCC**: Control systems for ground operations
- **CCC**: Cabin systems for passenger boarding
- **IIF**: Industrial infrastructure facilities

## Organization

Each ATA chapter contains specific systems organized as:

```
ATA-{XX}/
└── SYSTEMS/
    └── ATA-{XX}-{YY}/
        ├── PLM/              # Product Lifecycle Management
        │   └── CAx/          # Computer-Aided tools
        └── CONF/             # Configuration management
            └── BASELINE/
                └── COMPONENTS/
```

## Traceability

All systems maintain traceability to:
- System requirements
- Interface control documents (ICDs)
- Airport operational requirements
- Ground handling standards
