- Cryogenic storage under **ATA-47** (CQH domain)
- Enhanced safety protocols
- Leak detection and mitigation
- Special materials and sealing

## Traceability

All systems maintain traceability to:
- System requirements
- Interface control documents (ICDs)
- Engine type certificate
- Certification requirements
- Safety requirements (FMEA/FHA)
- Test and verification records
- Hydrogen safety requirements
