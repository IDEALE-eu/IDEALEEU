# 51-30 FASTENERS, JOINTS & BONDING — Structures (BWB-H2-Hy-E, Q100)

**Under System:** 51-STRUCTURES-GENERAL • **Architecture:** BWB-H2-Hy-E • **Domain:** AAA-AIRFRAMES-AERODYNAMICS-AIRWORTHINESS

## Purpose
Define joint design standards, fastener selection criteria, and bonding/adhesive processes for all structural joints.

## Deliverables
- Joint design catalog (riveted, bolted, bonded, co-bonded, hybrid)
- Fastener selection matrix and installation specifications
- Adhesive selection and surface preparation requirements
- Joint design allowables and analysis methods
- Quality control and inspection procedures for joints

## Interfaces
- **53 Fuselage**: Joint design for fuselage panel attachments
- **57 Wing**: Joint design for wing spar/rib connections
- **54 Nacelles/Pylons**: Joint design for engine mounts
- **51-00 General**: Feeds into JOINT_CATEGORIES.yaml
- **51-20 Manufacturing**: Fastener installation processes
- **51-40 Corrosion**: Sealing and corrosion protection of joints

## PLM/CAx
- `PLM/CAx/CAD/` — Joint typology models and fastener libraries
- `PLM/CAx/CAE/` — Joint analysis models and stress distributions
- `PLM/CAx/CAV/` — Joint qualification test data

## CM & Compliance
- Joint design changes via ECR/ECO (CCB)
- New joint types require full qualification testing
- Traceability to fastener and adhesive specifications
