    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ATA-{XX}-{YY}/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PLM/              # Product Lifecycle Management
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CAx/          # Computer-Aided tools
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CONF/             # Configuration management
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BASELINE/
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ COMPONENTS/
```

## Special Note on ATA-92 (EWIS)

**ATA-92 is the AUTHORITATIVE chapter for all electrical wiring.** All wiring designs, installations, and modifications must be documented and controlled within this chapter, regardless of which system the wiring serves.

## Traceability

All systems maintain traceability to:
- System requirements
- Interface control documents (ICDs)
- Electrical load analysis
- Certification requirements
- EWIS requirements
- Safety requirements
