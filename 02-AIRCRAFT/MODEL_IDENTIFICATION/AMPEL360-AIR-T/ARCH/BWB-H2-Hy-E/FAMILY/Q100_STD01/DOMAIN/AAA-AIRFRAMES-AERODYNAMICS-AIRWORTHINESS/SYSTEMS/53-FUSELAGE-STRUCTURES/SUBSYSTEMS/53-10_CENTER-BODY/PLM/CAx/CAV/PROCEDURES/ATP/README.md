# ATP — Acceptance Test Procedures

## Purpose

Acceptance Test Procedures (ATP) verify that manufactured center body structures meet design specifications and workmanship standards before proceeding to qualification testing.

## Scope

ATPs cover:
- Dimensional inspection
- Material verification
- Workmanship quality
- Assembly verification
- Functional checks (where applicable)

## Typical ATPs for 53-10 CENTER-BODY

1. **ATP-53-10-001** — Dimensional Inspection
2. **ATP-53-10-002** — Material Certification Review
3. **ATP-53-10-003** — Composite Layup Verification
4. **ATP-53-10-004** — Bond Line Inspection
5. **ATP-53-10-005** — NDT Acceptance (Ultrasonic, X-ray)
6. **ATP-53-10-006** — Surface Quality Inspection
7. **ATP-53-10-007** — Fastener Installation Verification

## Acceptance Criteria

- All dimensions within drawing tolerances
- Materials traceable to approved specifications
- Workmanship per manufacturing specifications
- No defects exceeding allowable limits
- NDT results within acceptance standards

## Test Article Disposition

- **ACCEPT** — Proceed to qualification testing
- **ACCEPT WITH DEVIATION** — Document deviation, obtain approval
- **REJECT** — Return for rework or scrap

## Documentation

Each ATP execution produces:
- Completed procedure with signoffs
- Inspection data sheets
- NDT reports
- Material certifications
- Photographs of critical features
- Disposition recommendation
