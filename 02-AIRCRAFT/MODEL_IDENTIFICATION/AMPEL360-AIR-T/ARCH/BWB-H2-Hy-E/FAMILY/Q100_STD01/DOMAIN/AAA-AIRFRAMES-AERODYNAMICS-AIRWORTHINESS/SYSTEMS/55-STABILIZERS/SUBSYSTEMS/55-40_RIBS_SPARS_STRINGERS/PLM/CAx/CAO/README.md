# CAO - Computer-Aided Optimization

## Purpose

This directory contains CAO artifacts including optimization studies, trade-off analyses, design space exploration results, and Pareto frontiers.

## File Organization

- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Include optimization objective and revision in filename
- Document design variables and constraints
- Maintain traceability to requirements

## Naming Convention

```
{OBJECTIVE}_{DESCRIPTION}_{REV}.{ext}
```

Example: `MASS_Wing_Structure_Optimization_R001.py`

## Standards

- Follow applicable CAO standards for this discipline
- Ensure traceability to optimization objectives
- Maintain configuration control
- Document convergence criteria and results

## Typical Content

- **VARIABLES/** — Design variable definitions
