## BWB-Specific Considerations

For the Blended Wing Body (BWB) architecture:
- Integrated wing-body structure
- Load distribution across wider area
- Unique structural challenges
- Combined aerodynamic and structural optimization

## Design Requirements

### Structural
- Ultimate load capability
- Damage tolerance
- Fatigue life requirements
- Crashworthiness
- Lightning protection

### Manufacturing
- Composite manufacturing processes
- Assembly procedures
- Quality control requirements
- Non-destructive testing (NDT)

### Materials
- Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP)
- Aluminum alloys
- Titanium (selective locations)
- Advanced composites

## Analysis & Verification

### Analysis Methods
- Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
- Static testing
- Fatigue testing
- Ultimate load testing
- Bird strike analysis

### Verification
- Ground testing
- Flight testing
- Certification testing
- Service experience

## Certification Basis
