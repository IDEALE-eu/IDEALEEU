# DATA — Engineering Databases

## Purpose
Centralized engineering data repositories for loads and materials used in structural analysis.

## Subdirectories

### LOADS_DB/ — Loads Database
Repository of structural loads and load cases:
- Flight loads (limit and ultimate)
- Ground loads (landing, taxiing, towing)
- Pressurization loads (differential pressure)
- Emergency loads (crash, ditching)
- Combined load cases
- Load distribution files
- Load factors and safety factors

**Format**: CSV, Excel, HDF5, or solver-specific formats
**Traceability**: Link to loads analysis reports and flight envelope

### MATERIALS_DB/ — Materials Database
Material properties and allowables:
- Material property cards (isotropic, orthotropic)
- Temperature-dependent properties
- A-basis and B-basis allowables
- Fatigue curves (S-N data)
- Fracture toughness data
- Composite layup definitions
- Material specifications and certifications

**Format**: Material libraries, XML, JSON, or solver-specific formats
**Traceability**: Link to material test reports and certifications

## Guidelines
- Maintain version control for all database entries
- Include source references for all data
- Document applicable temperature and moisture conditions
- Use consistent unit systems
- Archive test reports supporting material allowables
- Update databases when new test data becomes available
