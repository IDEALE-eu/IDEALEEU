# Q100_STD01 Family Configuration

## Overview

Q100_STD01 represents the standard configuration for the Q100 family variant of the BWB-H2-Hy-E architecture.

## Configuration Details

- **Family**: Q100
- **Standard**: STD01
- **Baseline**: Production baseline
- **Status**: Active development

## Engineering Domains

This family configuration is organized by engineering domains:

### Available Domains

- **[AAA-AIRFRAMES-AERODYNAMICS-AIRWORTHINESS/](./DOMAIN/AAA-AIRFRAMES-AERODYNAMICS-AIRWORTHINESS/)** - Structural and aerodynamic systems
- CCC-COCKPIT-CABIN-CARGO - Cabin and cargo systems
- CQH-CRYOGENICS-QUANTUM-H2 - Hydrogen and cryogenic systems
- EDI-ELECTRONICS-DIGITAL-INSTRUMENTS - Electronics and instruments
- EEE-ELECTRICAL-ENDOTRANSPONDERS-CIRCULATION - Electrical systems
- PPP-PROPULSION-FUEL-SYSTEMS - Propulsion systems
- And others...

## Organization Principle

Each domain contains ATA chapters, which in turn contain specific systems following the hierarchy:

```
DOMAIN/{DOMAIN_ID}/ATA-{XX}/SYSTEMS/ATA-{XX}-{YY}/
```

Where:
- **DOMAIN_ID**: Domain identifier
- **ATA-XX**: ATA chapter number
- **ATA-XX-YY**: Specific system within the chapter

## Change Control

All configurations are subject to:
- Configuration Control Board (CCB) approval
- Change request process
- Version control
- Traceability requirements
