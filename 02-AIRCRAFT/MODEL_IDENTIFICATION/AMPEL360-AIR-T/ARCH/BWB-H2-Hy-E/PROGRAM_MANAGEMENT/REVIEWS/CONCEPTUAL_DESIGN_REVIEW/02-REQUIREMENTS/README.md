## Deliverables

### REQ-001: System Requirements Document (SRD)
**Status**: Template  
**Owner**: Systems Engineering Lead  
**UTCS**: TBD

#### Content
- Top-level aircraft requirements
- Performance requirements (range, speed, payload)
- Environmental requirements (emissions, noise)
- Certification basis and regulatory requirements
- Safety and reliability requirements
- Maintainability and supportability requirements

#### Template
See: [REQ-001_SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md](./REQ-001_SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md)

---

### REQ-002: Requirements Traceability Matrix
**Status**: Template  
**Owner**: Systems Engineering Lead  
**UTCS**: TBD

#### Content
- Stakeholder needs to system requirements mapping
- Requirements allocation to subsystems
- Verification method for each requirement
- Requirements status and compliance tracking

#### Template
See: [REQ-002_REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.csv](./REQ-002_REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.csv)

---

### REQ-003: Design Constraints Document
**Status**: Template  
**Owner**: Systems Engineering Lead  
**UTCS**: TBD

#### Content
- Physical constraints (size, weight limits)
- Operational constraints (airports, weather)
- Regulatory constraints
- Technology readiness constraints
- Cost and schedule constraints

#### Template
See: [REQ-003_DESIGN_CONSTRAINTS_DOCUMENT.md](./REQ-003_DESIGN_CONSTRAINTS_DOCUMENT.md)
