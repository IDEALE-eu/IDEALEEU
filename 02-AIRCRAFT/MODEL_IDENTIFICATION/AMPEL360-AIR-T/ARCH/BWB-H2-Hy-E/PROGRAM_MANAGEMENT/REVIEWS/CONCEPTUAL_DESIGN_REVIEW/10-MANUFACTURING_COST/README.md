## Overview

Manufacturing feasibility assessment, assembly concepts, and program cost estimates.

---

## Deliverables

### MFG-001: Manufacturing Feasibility Assessment
Key manufacturing challenges, proposed processes, tooling/facilities requirements, supply chain, make-vs-buy.

### MFG-002: Assembly Concept
Major assembly sequence, assembly facility requirements, critical interfaces, quality control approach.

### COST-001: Program Cost Estimate
Development cost estimate by phase, unit cost estimate (recurring), cost estimating methodology, uncertainty.

### COST-002: Economic Analysis
Operating cost per flight hour, cost per seat-mile, fuel cost assumptions, maintenance costs, ROI analysis.
