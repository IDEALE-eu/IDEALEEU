## Limitations and Assumptions

### Assumptions
1. **Sensor Health**: Vibration sensors are calibrated and functioning correctly
2. **Data Quality**: Sensor data sample rate is consistent (100 Hz ±10%)
3. **Training Coverage**: Training data covers 95% of normal operational envelope
4. **Anomaly Threshold**: Reconstruction error > 3.5σ indicates anomaly (tuned to 2.7% FAR)

### Known Limitations
1. **False Positives**: ~2.7% false positive rate (250 false alerts per 10,000 flights)
   - Most common during high transient events (takeoff, landing)
2. **Novel Fault Types**: May not detect faults not represented in training data
   - "Other/Unknown" category shows 69% recall
3. **Inference Latency**: 12ms per window (acceptable for ground operations, may need optimization for edge)
4. **Small Anomalies**: Detection threshold optimized for safety (may miss very early-stage degradation)

### Out-of-Scope
- **Fault Localization**: Model detects anomalies but does not localize to specific bearing or component
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Does not identify underlying failure mechanism (requires expert diagnosis)
- **Other Engine Systems**: Focused on vibration only (not oil system, fuel system, thermal anomalies)
- **Multi-Engine Correlation**: Analyzes each engine independently (no cross-engine patterns)

---

## Fairness and Bias

### Fairness Considerations
Model performance is consistent across:
- **Aircraft Variants**: Passenger (AUC=0.92), Cargo (AUC=0.91), Long-Range (AUC=0.93)
- **Engine Manufacturers**: Engine A (AUC=0.92), Engine B (AUC=0.91)
- **Geographic Regions**: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific (AUC variance <0.015)
- **Seasonal Conditions**: Summer, Winter, Monsoon (AUC variance <0.02)

### Bias Mitigation
- Training data balanced across aircraft variants (33% PAX, 34% CARGO, 33% LONG_RANGE)
- Stratified sampling by flight phase (matches operational distribution)
- Equal representation of environmental conditions (hot/cold, humid/dry)

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Potential Harms
1. **False Negative (Missed Anomaly)**: 
   - **Harm**: Undetected bearing failure → potential engine shutdown, safety risk
   - **Likelihood**: 12.5% of true anomalies (recall = 87.5%)
2. **False Positive (False Alert)**:
   - **Harm**: Unnecessary maintenance, aircraft downtime, operational cost
   - **Likelihood**: 2.7% of normal operation
3. **Over-Reliance**:
   - **Harm**: Human operators may defer judgment to model, missing novel fault types
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (requires training and cultural change)

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Dual Validation**: Critical alerts (severity ≥ moderate) trigger independent sensor check
2. **Human-in-the-Loop**: All high-severity alerts reviewed by maintenance engineer before action
3. **Shadow Mode**: 30-day shadow mode deployment before enabling automated alerts
4. **Operator Training**: Training program for maintenance crews on model limitations and interpretation
5. **Explainability**: Reconstruction error heatmap shows which sensors contribute to anomaly score

## Maintenance and Updates

### Monitoring
- **Data Drift**: Population Stability Index (PSI) monitored daily (alert if >0.25)
- **Concept Drift**: ADWIN algorithm monitors reconstruction error distribution (alert if shift detected)
- **Performance Tracking**: 
  - AUC computed weekly on recent flight data (alert if <0.85)
  - False alarm rate tracked daily (alert if >5%)
- **Operational Metrics**: Inference latency, CPU usage, memory footprint

### Retraining Triggers
1. **Data Drift Detected**: PSI >0.25 for 7 consecutive days
2. **Performance Degradation**: AUC <0.85 for 2 consecutive weeks
3. **Concept Drift**: ADWIN alert + manual validation
4. **New Fault Types**: Novel anomaly patterns identified by experts (quarterly review)
5. **Fleet Expansion**: New aircraft variant or engine type introduced

### Update Policy
See `../../08-SYNCHRONISATION/UPDATE_POLICY.md`:
- **Ring Deployment**: 10% fleet → 50% fleet → 100% fleet
- **Shadow Mode**: 30 days minimum before enabling alerts
- **Rollback Criteria**: If FAR exceeds 7% or major incident occurs

### Model Versioning
- **Semantic Versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- **Major**: Breaking changes (input schema change, algorithm change)
- **Minor**: Performance improvements (retrained model, new features)
- **Patch**: Bug fixes, no model change

## Explainability

### Model Interpretability
Partial interpretability via:
1. **Reconstruction Error Heatmap**: Shows which input features contribute most to anomaly score
   - Example: High reconstruction error on `vib_fan_rms` → fan bearing anomaly suspected
2. **Feature Importance**: Post-hoc analysis using permutation importance
3. **Attention Maps**: (Planned for v2.0) Attention mechanism to highlight temporal patterns

### Feature Importance (Permutation-Based)

Top 5 features for anomaly detection:
1. **vib_fan_rms** (35% importance) - RMS fan bearing vibration
2. **vib_compressor_rms** (28% importance) - RMS compressor bearing vibration
3. **vib_imbalance_score** (18% importance) - FFT 1P ratio (blade imbalance indicator)
4. **vib_turbine_rms** (12% importance) - RMS turbine bearing vibration
5. **n1_rate_of_change** (7% importance) - Transient detection

### Example Explainability Output
```
Alert: Anomaly Detected (Severity: Moderate)
Reconstruction Error: 8.2 (Threshold: 3.5)

Feature Contributions:
  vib_fan_rms: 4.1 (HIGH - primary contributor)
  vib_compressor_rms: 2.0 (MODERATE)
  vib_imbalance_score: 1.5 (MODERATE)
  vib_turbine_rms: 0.4 (LOW)
  n1_rate_of_change: 0.2 (LOW)

Interpretation: Elevated fan bearing vibration detected. 
Recommend: Inspect fan bearing, check for blade imbalance.
```
