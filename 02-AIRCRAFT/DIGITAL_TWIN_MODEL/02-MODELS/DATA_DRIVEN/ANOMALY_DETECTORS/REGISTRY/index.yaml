# Governance
governance:
  review_cycle: quarterly
  change_process: ECR required for model changes
  approvers:
    - Configuration Control Board (CCB)
    - Safety Review Board
    - Data Science Lead
  
  retraining_policy:
    triggers:
      - Data drift (PSI > 0.25 for 7 days)
      - Performance degradation (AUC < threshold)
      - New fault types identified
      - Fleet expansion
    schedule: quarterly_or_triggered
    
  retirement_policy:
    criteria:
      - Model replaced by newer version
      - Use case no longer relevant
      - Persistent performance issues
    process: Gradual phase-out over 3 months minimum
