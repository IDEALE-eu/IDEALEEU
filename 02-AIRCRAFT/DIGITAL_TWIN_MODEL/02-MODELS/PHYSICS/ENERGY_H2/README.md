Hydrogen fuel system models: tanks, balance-of-plant (BOP), boil-off, and leak detection.

## Purpose

Models for H₂ storage, handling, and safety monitoring.

## Contents

- **TANK_MODELS/** - H₂ tank thermodynamics (pressure, temperature, boil-off)
- **BOP/** - Balance-of-plant (pumps, valves, vaporizers, regulators)
- **BOIL_OFF/** - Boil-off rate prediction models
- **LEAK_DETECTION/** - H₂ concentration monitoring and leak prediction

## ATA Chapter Links

- **ATA-28** - Fuel (H₂ fuel system)

## Fidelity Levels

- **Level 5 (Real-Time)**: 0D tank model, <10ms
- **Level 4 (High-Fidelity)**: 3D sloshing CFD, hours
- **Level 3 (Detailed)**: 1D flow network, seconds

## Validation Requirements

- Ground test correlation: Boil-off rate within ±5%, pressure within ±2%
- Leak detection: Sensitivity >10 ppm, false positive rate <1%
