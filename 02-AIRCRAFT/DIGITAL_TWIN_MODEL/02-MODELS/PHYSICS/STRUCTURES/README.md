Finite Element Method (FEM) models, fatigue analysis, and structural margin calculations.

## Purpose

Structural models for stress, fatigue, and damage tolerance analysis of aircraft structures.

## Contents

- **FEM_MODELS/** - Finite element models (static, modal, buckling)
- **FATIGUE/** - Fatigue life prediction models (S-N curves, crack growth)
- **MARGINS/** - Structural margin calculations (reserve factors, safety factors)

## ATA Chapter Links

- **ATA-51** - Structures (general)
- **ATA-53** - Fuselage
- **ATA-55** - Stabilizers
- **ATA-57** - Wings

## Fidelity Levels

- **Level 5 (Real-Time)**: Margin lookup, <1ms
- **Level 4 (High-Fidelity)**: Full FEM, hours
- **Level 3 (Detailed)**: Reduced FEM, minutes

## Validation Requirements

- Ground test correlation: Stress within ±5%, deflection within ±3%
- Fatigue: Correlation with test articles (crack initiation within 20%)
