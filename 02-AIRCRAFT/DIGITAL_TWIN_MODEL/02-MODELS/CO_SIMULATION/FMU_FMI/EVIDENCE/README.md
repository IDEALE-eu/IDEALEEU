**📍 [IDEALE-EU](../../../../../) > [02-AIRCRAFT](../../../../) > [DIGITAL_TWIN_MODEL](../../../) > 02-MODELS/CO_SIMULATION/FMU_FMI > EVIDENCE**

Test evidence, determinism verification, KPI reports, and coverage analysis.

## Purpose

This directory archives formal evidence of:
- Test execution results
- Determinism validation (bit-exact repeatability)
- Performance KPIs
- Requirement coverage
- Compliance reports

## Evidence Types

### Test Reports
- Test vector execution summaries
- Pass/fail statistics
- Traceability matrices

### Determinism Verification
- Repeated execution logs showing identical results
- Bit-exact reproduction evidence

### Coverage Analysis
- Requirement coverage reports
- Code coverage (for safety-critical components)
- Test coverage metrics

### Performance KPIs
- Execution time benchmarks
- Memory usage profiles
- Real-time performance metrics
