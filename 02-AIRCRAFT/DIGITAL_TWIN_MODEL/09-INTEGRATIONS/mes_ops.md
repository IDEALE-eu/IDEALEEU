# MES/Operations Integration

## Overview
Integration between Digital Twin Model and Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and operational systems.

## MES Integration

### Production Data Flow
- **As-Built Configuration**: Actual serial numbers, build dates
- **Quality Data**: Test results, inspection records
- **Process Parameters**: Assembly torques, cure times, alignments
- **Deviation Records**: Waivers, concessions, rework

### Digital Twin Updates
- Serial-specific model instantiation
- Parameter adjustments based on as-built data
- Quality-based initial conditions
- Deviation impact assessment

### MES Interfaces
- **System**: Siemens Opcenter (or equivalent)
- **Protocol**: OPC UA for real-time data
- **Batch**: Daily export of production records
- **Validation**: Data quality checks before model update

## Operations Integration

### Flight Operations
- **Source**: Flight Management System (FMS)
- **Data**: Flight plans, fuel logs, performance data
- **Frequency**: Post-flight batch upload
- **Usage**: Model validation, fleet trends

### Maintenance Operations
- **Source**: MRO system (AMOS, Quantum, etc.)
- **Data**: Work orders, findings, parts usage
- **Frequency**: Daily sync
- **Usage**: Health monitoring, predictive maintenance

### Telemetry Streams
- **Source**: ACARS, satcom, on-board recorders
- **Data**: Real-time sensor data during flight
- **Frequency**: Continuous streaming (1-10 Hz)
- **Usage**: Live state estimation, anomaly detection

## Data Quality Assurance
- **Completeness**: All required fields present
- **Timeliness**: Data within latency requirements
- **Accuracy**: Cross-validation with multiple sources
- **Consistency**: Business rule compliance

## Privacy and Security
- Operational data anonymized for analytics
- PII removed before model training
- Secure channels (TLS 1.3) for all transfers
- Access control per role (RBAC)
