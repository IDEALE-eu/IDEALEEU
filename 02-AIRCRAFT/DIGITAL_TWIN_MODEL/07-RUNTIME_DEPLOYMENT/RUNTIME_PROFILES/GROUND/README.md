# GROUND RUNTIME PROFILE

**📍 [IDEALE-EU](../../../../) > [02-AIRCRAFT](../../../) > [DIGITAL_TWIN_MODEL](../../) > 07-RUNTIME_DEPLOYMENT/RUNTIME_PROFILES > GROUND**

Operations center: Full analytics, what-if scenarios, batch processing.

## Purpose

Runtime profile for digital twin models deployed in ground operations center (cloud or on-premise).

## Constraints

- **CPU Usage**: No hard limit (scalable)
- **Memory**: Scalable (10-100 GB)
- **Storage**: Scalable (TB-scale for historical data)
- **Network**: Continuous connectivity, secure VPN/API gateway
- **Updates**: Frequent updates (daily for data-driven models, as-needed for physics models)

## Deployed Models

### All Fidelity Levels (L1-L5)
- Real-time models (Level 5) for dashboards
- High-fidelity models (Level 3-4) for deep analysis
- Batch analytics (daily/weekly reports)
- What-if scenarios (interactive)

## Compute Environment

- **Platform**: Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premise datacenter
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for service management
- **Runtime**: ONNX Runtime (GPU-enabled), Python, MATLAB
- **Database**: Time-series DB (InfluxDB), relational DB (PostgreSQL), blob storage (MinIO)

```

## Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add model runtime pods for increased load
- **Vertical Scaling**: GPU instances for compute-intensive models (CFD surrogates)
- **Auto-Scaling**: CPU >70% or queue depth >100 triggers scale-up

## Deployment Process

1. **Model Development**: Train/tune models (see `../../05-CALIBRATION_ALIGNMENT/`)
2. **Validation**: V&V on ground (see `../../06-VALIDATION_VERIFICATION/`)
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, test, deploy (see `../../12-CODE/CI_CD/`)
4. **Canary Deployment**: Deploy to 10% of fleet, monitor for 7 days
5. **Full Rollout**: Deploy to 100% of fleet
6. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring (see `../../10-METRICS/`)
