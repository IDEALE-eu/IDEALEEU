# Digital Twin Safety Plan

## Document Control
- **Document ID**: DT-SAFETY-001
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Owner**: Safety Engineer
- **Approval**: Chief Engineer

## Purpose
Define safety requirements, hazards, and mitigations for the Digital Twin Model system.

## Scope
This plan covers:
- Model development and validation
- Runtime deployment (edge, ground, cloud)
- Operational use in decision support
- Data integrity and cybersecurity

## Safety-Critical Classification

### Level A (Catastrophic)
- **Models**: Flight control, structural loads, H₂ leak detection
- **Requirements**: DO-178C Level A software assurance
- **V&V**: Full formal verification, extensive testing
- **Deployment**: No autonomous updates, manual approval required

### Level B (Hazardous)
- **Models**: Propulsion performance, thermal management, energy balance
- **Requirements**: DO-178C Level B software assurance
- **V&V**: Comprehensive testing, peer review
- **Deployment**: Staged rollout with monitoring

### Level C (Major)
- **Models**: Predictive maintenance, health monitoring
- **Requirements**: Standard software practices
- **V&V**: Unit and integration testing
- **Deployment**: Standard deployment procedures

### Level D (Minor)
- **Models**: Operational optimization, efficiency recommendations
- **Requirements**: Code review and basic testing
- **V&V**: Smoke testing
- **Deployment**: Continuous deployment allowed

## Safety Requirements

### SR-001: No Autonomous Control
Digital twin outputs must not directly command safety-critical actuators without human-in-the-loop approval.

### SR-002: Bounded Predictions
All model predictions must be bounded by physical limits and validated envelopes.

### SR-003: Graceful Degradation
System must fail safe with known-good fallback when model errors detected.

### SR-004: Audit Trail
All model inputs, outputs, and decisions must be logged with tamper-proof timestamps.

### SR-005: Update Restrictions
Safety-critical models (Level A/B) must not update during flight operations.

## Hazard Boundaries

### Structural Loads
- **Max Load Factor**: ±3.5 g (transport category)
- **Confidence**: 99.9%
- **Action**: Alert if prediction exceeds 85% of limit

### H₂ Pressure
- **Max Pressure**: 350 bar
- **Confidence**: 99.99%
- **Action**: Immediate alert and system shutdown trigger

### Temperature Limits
- **Cryogenic Min**: 20 K
- **Max Operating**: 350 K
- **Action**: Alert and limit control inputs

## Verification & Validation

### Model V&V
- Requirements traceability (100%)
- Unit test coverage (>90%)
- Integration testing (all interfaces)
- System testing (all scenarios)
- Flight test validation (correlation >95%)

### Safety Case
- Formal safety argument per ARP4761
- Fault tree analysis (FTA)
- Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA)
- Common cause analysis (CCA)

## Compliance Standards
- **ARP4754A**: Systems engineering, safety assessment
- **DO-178C**: Software considerations in airborne systems
- **DO-254**: Hardware design assurance
- **DO-326A/355/356A**: Airworthiness security

## Change Management
All safety-related changes must:
1. Undergo hazard analysis
2. Update safety case
3. Receive safety engineer approval
4. Be documented in CCB minutes

## Review and Updates
- **Frequency**: Annual or upon significant changes
- **Triggers**: New hazards, regulatory changes, incidents
- **Approval**: Safety Review Board
