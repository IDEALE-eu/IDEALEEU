# Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Test Plan

## Objective
Validate digital twin models against physical hardware to ensure fidelity and real-time performance.

## Test Setup

### Hardware Components
- Target controller (flight computer replica)
- Power supply unit (programmable)
- Electronic load bank (5 kW)
- Data acquisition system (1 kHz sampling)
- Real-time target (dSPACE or equivalent)

### Software Components
- Digital twin model (compiled for real-time)
- Test harness and automation scripts
- Data logging and visualization tools

## Test Phases

### Phase 1: Open-Loop Validation
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Objective**: Validate model outputs against sensor measurements
- **Scenarios**: Static and dynamic load profiles
- **Success Criteria**: Output correlation > 0.95

### Phase 2: Closed-Loop Integration
- **Duration**: 3 weeks
- **Objective**: Validate control loops in real-time with hardware
- **Scenarios**: MPPT operation, bus regulation, fault injection
- **Success Criteria**: Meets all control performance specifications

### Phase 3: Edge Cases and Stress Testing
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Objective**: Test model behavior at operational boundaries
- **Scenarios**: Overload, undervoltage, thermal extremes
- **Success Criteria**: Safe operation within defined envelopes

## Test Schedule
- Setup and calibration: Week 1
- Phase 1: Weeks 2-3
- Phase 2: Weeks 4-6
- Phase 3: Weeks 7-8
- Analysis and reporting: Week 9

## Deliverables
- HIL test report with correlation analysis
- Time-series validation plots
- Performance benchmarking results
- Issue log and resolution tracking
