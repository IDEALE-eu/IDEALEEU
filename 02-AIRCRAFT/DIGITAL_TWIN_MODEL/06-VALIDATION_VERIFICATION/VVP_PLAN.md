DO-160/ARP4754A-aligned acceptance criteria for digital twin validation and verification.

## Purpose

Define systematic V&V approach to ensure digital twin meets requirements and accurately represents physical aircraft.

## V&V Strategy

### Verification
**Definition**: "Are we building the product right?"  
**Objective**: Ensure models are implemented correctly (no coding errors, correct equations)

### Validation
**Definition**: "Are we building the right product?"  
**Objective**: Ensure models accurately represent physical reality

## Compliance Standards

- **ARP4754A**: Guidelines for Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems
- **DO-178C**: Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification
- **DO-160**: Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment
- **ISO 23247**: Digital twin framework for manufacturing

## V&V Levels by Model Criticality

| Safety Level | Failure Condition | V&V Rigor | Test Coverage | Independence |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Level A (Catastrophic)** | Loss of aircraft | Extensive | 100% (MC/DC) | Independent V&V team |
| **Level B (Hazardous)** | Serious injury | Rigorous | 100% (decision) | Peer review required |
| **Level C (Major)** | Discomfort | Moderate | 100% (statement) | Self-verification allowed |
| **Level D (Minor)** | Inconvenience | Basic | >80% (statement) | Self-verification allowed |

## Model Classification

### Level A Models (Safety-Critical)
- Flight control models (autopilot, stability augmentation)
- Structural load predictions (wing, fuselage stress)
- H₂ leak detection (safety interlocks)

### Level B Models
- Propulsion performance (thrust, fuel flow)
- Thermal management (H₂ boil-off, cabin temperature)
- Energy balance (range, endurance)

### Level C Models
- Predictive maintenance (RUL, anomaly detection)
- System health monitoring
- Performance optimization

### Level D Models
- Operational analytics (efficiency trends)
- Fleet benchmarking

## Verification Methods

### 1. Reviews and Analysis
- **Design Review**: Peer review of model equations, assumptions
- **Code Review**: Static analysis, coding standards compliance
- **Requirements Traceability**: Each requirement → test case

### 2. Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Individual model functions (pytest, MATLAB xUnit)
- **Integration Testing**: Model interfaces, co-simulation
- **System Testing**: End-to-end scenarios

### 3. Formal Methods (for Level A/B)
- **Static Analysis**: MISRA-C compliance, Polyspace
- **Model Checking**: Simulink Design Verifier
- **Proof of Correctness**: For critical algorithms

## Validation Methods

### 1. Comparison with Test Data
- **Ground Test**: Correlation with rig data (see `../05-CALIBRATION_ALIGNMENT/DATASETS/GROUND_TEST/`)
- **Flight Test**: Correlation with flight data (see `../05-CALIBRATION_ALIGNMENT/DATASETS/FLIGHT_TEST/`)
- **HIL/SIL**: Correlation with hardware-in-the-loop data

### 2. Cross-Validation
- **Model-to-Model**: Compare digital twin with independent models (e.g., OEM engine model)
- **Expert Review**: Subject matter expert assessment

### 3. Sensitivity Analysis
- **Parameter Perturbation**: Vary parameters, observe output changes
- **Monte Carlo**: Probabilistic validation with uncertainty quantification

## V&V Workflow

```
1. [Define Requirements] → Traceability matrix (requirement → test case)
2. [Design Test Cases] → TEST_CASES/ (scenarios, inputs, expected outputs)
3. [Execute Tests] → Automated (CI/CD) + Manual
4. [Collect Results] → RESULTS/ (pass/fail, metrics, plots)
5. [Analyze Discrepancies] → Root cause, model refinement
6. [Document Evidence] → Validation reports, correlation plots
7. [Certification Package] → CERT_EVIDENCE_LINKS.md (for authorities)
8. [CCB Approval] → Sign-off on V&V completion
```

## Independence Requirements

### Level A Models
- **V&V Team**: Independent from development team
- **Tools**: Qualified tools or tool qualification process
- **Review**: Independent review of all V&V artifacts

### Level B/C/D Models
- **Peer Review**: Minimum one independent reviewer
- **Self-Verification**: Allowed with documented process

## Regression Testing

After any model change:
1. **Impact Analysis**: Identify affected models, interfaces
2. **Regression Test Suite**: Execute subset of test cases
3. **Acceptance**: Pass rate >95% (no new failures)
