# Digital Twin Threat Model

## Scope

This document identifies security threats to the aircraft digital twin system and defines mitigation strategies.

## Threat Categories

### T1: Unauthorized Access
- **Threat**: Unauthorized users accessing twin data or controls
- **Impact**: Data breach, system manipulation
- **Mitigation**: Strong authentication (OAuth2, MFA), RBAC

### T2: Data Tampering
- **Threat**: Malicious modification of telemetry or model data
- **Impact**: Incorrect predictions, safety risk
- **Mitigation**: Cryptographic signatures, integrity checks

### T3: Denial of Service
- **Threat**: Overwhelming twin with requests, causing unavailability
- **Impact**: Loss of real-time monitoring capability
- **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, DDoS protection, load balancing

### T4: Data Exfiltration
- **Threat**: Sensitive flight data stolen by adversary
- **Impact**: Privacy violation, competitive disadvantage
- **Mitigation**: Encryption (TLS 1.3), data loss prevention

### T5: Model Poisoning
- **Threat**: Adversary corrupts ML models during training
- **Impact**: Degraded prediction accuracy
- **Mitigation**: Training data validation, model versioning

## Security Controls

- Authentication: OAuth2 + JWT
- Encryption: TLS 1.3 for transport, AES-256 for storage
- Access Control: Role-based (RBAC)
- Audit Logging: All API calls logged
- Monitoring: Intrusion detection system (IDS)

## Compliance

- GDPR (data privacy)
- ISO 27001 (information security management)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
