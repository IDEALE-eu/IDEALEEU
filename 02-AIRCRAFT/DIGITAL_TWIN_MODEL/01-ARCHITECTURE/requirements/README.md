Digital twin requirements and traceability.

## Purpose

This directory contains requirements for the digital twin system, including functional requirements, performance requirements, and traceability to system-level requirements.

## Contents

- **[rqmts_list.csv](rqmts_list.csv)** - List of all digital twin requirements
- **[traceability.yaml](traceability.yaml)** - Requirements traceability matrix

## Requirements Categories

### Functional Requirements
- Model fidelity and accuracy
- Data ingestion and processing
- API functionality
- Analytics capabilities

### Performance Requirements
- Model execution time
- Data latency
- System throughput
- Resource utilization

### Interface Requirements
- API specifications
- Data format standards
- Protocol definitions

### Quality Requirements
- Validation criteria
- Calibration requirements
- Drift detection thresholds

## Traceability

Requirements trace to:
- System-level requirements (from aircraft program)
- Use cases (see ../TWIN_SCOPE.md)
- Verification methods (see ../validation/)
- Implementation artifacts (see ../../12-CODE/)
