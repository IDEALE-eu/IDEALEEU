# DIGITAL_TWIN_MODEL

**📍 [IDEALE-EU](../../) > [02-AIRCRAFT](../) > DIGITAL_TWIN_MODEL**

Aircraft digital twin model implementation, including physics-based models, behavioral models, data-driven ML models, and co-simulation orchestration.

## Purpose

This directory contains the complete digital twin model for the aircraft program, providing a virtual representation that mirrors the physical aircraft throughout its lifecycle. The digital twin enables:
- Predictive and prescriptive analytics
- What-if scenario analysis
- Real-time operational support
- Safety-critical decision support with guardrails

## Scope

### In-Scope
- **Physics Models**: Aerodynamics (CFD surrogates, polars), structures (FEM, fatigue), thermal (cryo/HX), propulsion (engine/EM), H₂ energy systems
- **Behavioral Models**: State machines, control logic, autopilot/EMS interfaces
- **Data-Driven Models**: Surrogates (regressors, GPR, ROM), anomaly detectors, ONNX inference artifacts
- **Co-Simulation**: FMU/FMI orchestration with error control
- **Per-Aircraft Instances**: Serialized twin instances for each aircraft (ACFT-XXXX)

### Out-of-Scope
- Ground support equipment (GSE) twins (see `01-FLEET/MRO_STRATEGY/`)
- Manufacturing process twins (see `02-AIRCRAFT/FINAL_ASSEMBLY_OPS/`)
- Purely conceptual models without validation basis

## Safety-of-Flight Guardrails

**Critical Safety Constraints**:
1. **No Autotuning on Safety-Critical Paths**: Model parameters affecting flight control, propulsion, or structural integrity must not be updated in-flight
2. **Hard Bounds**: All model outputs must be validated against physical limits (e.g., H₂ temp >20K, pressure <350 bar)
3. **Interlocks**: Model-based commands require dual validation (model + independent check)
4. **Validation Envelope**: Models only valid within calibrated operational envelope (see `01-ARCHITECTURE/ASSUMPTIONS_LIMITATIONS.md`)
5. **Edge Runtime Constraints**: On-aircraft CPU usage <15%, no remote updates during flight phases

**Safety-Critical Model Classification**:
- **Level A (Catastrophic)**: Flight control models, structural load predictions, H₂ leak detection
- **Level B (Hazardous)**: Propulsion performance, thermal management, energy balance
- **Level C (Major)**: Predictive maintenance, system health monitoring
- **Level D (Minor)**: Operational optimization, efficiency recommendations
