# Data Contracts

## Overview
Data contracts define the schema, semantics, and quality expectations for data exchanged between systems.

## Contract Types

### Input Contracts
- Sensor data from aircraft systems
- Telemetry streams from flight operations
- Configuration parameters from PLM

### Output Contracts
- Simulation results
- State estimates
- Predictions and alerts

## Schema Registry
All contracts are registered in the enterprise schema registry with versioning and backward compatibility tracking.

## Quality Expectations
- Completeness: All required fields must be present
- Timeliness: Data must arrive within specified latency bounds
- Accuracy: Data must meet defined precision and error bounds
- Consistency: Data must conform to business rules and constraints
