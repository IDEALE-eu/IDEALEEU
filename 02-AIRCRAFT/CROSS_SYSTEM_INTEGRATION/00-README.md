- Unique identifier
- DAL assignment
- Latency budget
- Participating LRUs and interfaces
- Traceability to requirements and hazards

## Integration Philosophy

Cross-system integration follows these principles:

1. **Top-Down Architecture** - System-level functional chains drive interface definitions
2. **Rigorous Interface Control** - All interfaces formally controlled via ICDs
3. **Budget-Driven Design** - Latency, power, thermal budgets allocated and tracked
4. **Defense-in-Depth** - Multiple layers of safety monitors and FDIR
5. **Model-Based Integration** - Co-simulation validates integration before hardware
6. **Evidence-Based Verification** - All integration claims backed by test evidence
7. **Configuration Control** - Strict baseline management and change control
8. **Traceability** - Requirements → Architecture → Design → Test → Evidence

## Quality Gates

Integration artifacts are reviewed at program stage gates:
- **SRR** - System context and high-level functional chains defined
- **PDR** - Architecture, interfaces, and budgets allocated
- **CDR** - Detailed design complete, ICDs approved
- **TRR** - Integration test procedures ready, test rigs operational
- **PRR** - Production baselines locked, manufacturing readiness
- **ORR/EIS** - Operational configuration verified, entry into service
- **FRR** - Flight readiness review, airworthiness certification

## Governance

- **Authority**: Systems Integration Lead, Chief Engineer
- **Approval**: Configuration Control Board (CCB)
- **Reviews**: Quarterly cross-system integration reviews
- **Metrics**: Tracked in 14-METRICS/, reported monthly
