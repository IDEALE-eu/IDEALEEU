# SAFETY â€” Safety Analysis Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains safety analyses including hazard analyses, safety FMEA, single-point failure analyses, and fault tolerance assessments.

## Contents

This directory includes:
- Hazard analysis reports
- Safety FMEA
- Single-point failure analyses
- Fault tolerance assessments
- Catastrophic failure analyses
- Safety risk assessments

### Analysis Types

**Hazard Analysis**
- Identification of hazardous conditions
- Causes and effects
- Severity and probability
- Mitigation measures

**Single-Point Failure Analysis**
- Critical components identified
- Redundancy assessment
- Failure detection capability
- Safe mode operations

**Fault Tolerance**
- Redundancy strategy
- Fail-safe design features
- Failure accommodation

## File Naming

```
21-10-CMP-ANAL_safety_<topic>__r<NN>__<STATUS>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- PDF reports for narratives and summaries
- Excel files for tabulated data
- Reference detailed models in [`../../../CAE/`](../../../CAE/)

## Documentation Requirements

Each analysis report shall include:
1. Objective and scope
2. Analysis method and assumptions
3. Model description (reference to CAE)
4. Results and margins
5. Conclusions and recommendations

## Verification

- Analysis results verified by independent review
- Correlation to test data when applicable
- Model validation documented
- Margins assessed against requirements

## Standards

- **NASA-STD-7009**: Standard for models and simulations
- **ECSS-E-ST-10C**: System engineering general requirements
- Discipline-specific standards as applicable
