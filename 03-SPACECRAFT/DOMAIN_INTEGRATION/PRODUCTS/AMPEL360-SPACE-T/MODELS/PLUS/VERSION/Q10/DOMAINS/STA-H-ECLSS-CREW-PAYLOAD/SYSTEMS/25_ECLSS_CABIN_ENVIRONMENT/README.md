# 25_ECLSS_CABIN_ENVIRONMENT

## Overview

The Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) provides a habitable environment for crew and payload accommodation. This system integrates atmosphere control, pressure regulation, CO₂ and trace gas removal, humidity management, water/waste systems, fire suppression, environmental sensors, control interfaces, and operations/maintenance.

## System Description

The ECLSS Cabin Environment system is responsible for:
- Maintaining breathable atmosphere composition
- Regulating cabin pressure
- Removing CO₂ and trace gases
- Managing humidity levels
- Handling water supply and waste
- Coordinating fire suppression with safety systems
- Monitoring environmental conditions
- Integrating with control systems
- Supporting operations and maintenance activities

## Operational Modes

1. **Nominal Operations**: Full ECLSS functionality with all subsystems operational
2. **Reduced Capability**: Limited functionality with degraded subsystems
3. **Emergency Mode**: Critical life support only, fire suppression active
4. **Maintenance Mode**: System or subsystem offline for maintenance

## Key Performance Parameters

- Cabin pressure: Target pressure range
- Oxygen partial pressure: Life support requirements
- CO₂ removal rate: Based on crew size
- Humidity range: Comfort and equipment protection
- Water supply capacity: Per crew member per day
- Response time: Emergency detection and response

## Chapter Consolidation Notes

This system consolidates the following legacy spacecraft chapters:
- **Ch. 35** → Subsystem 25-20 (Pressure Regulation)
- **Ch. 36** → Subsystem 25-30 (CO₂ and Trace Gas Removal)
- **Ch. 37** → Subsystem 25-40 (Humidity Management)
- **Ch. 38** → Subsystem 25-50 (Water/Waste System)

The consolidation provides a unified ECLSS architecture while maintaining traceability to legacy chapter organization.
