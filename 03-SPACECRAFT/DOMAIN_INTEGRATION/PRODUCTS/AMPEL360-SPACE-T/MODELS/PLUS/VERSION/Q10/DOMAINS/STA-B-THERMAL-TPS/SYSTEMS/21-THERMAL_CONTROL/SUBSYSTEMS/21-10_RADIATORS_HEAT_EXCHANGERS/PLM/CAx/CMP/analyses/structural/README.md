# STRUCTURAL â€” Structural Analysis Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains structural analysis reports including stress, flatness, stiffness analyses, and structural margin assessments for radiator panels and mounting interfaces.

## Contents

This directory includes:
- Stress analysis reports (static and dynamic loads)
- Flatness and deflection analyses
- Stiffness and frequency analyses
- Structural margin summaries
- Interface load analyses
- Fastener and joint analyses

### Analysis Types

**Static Analysis**
- Launch acceleration loads
- Handling and assembly loads
- Thermal stress analysis

**Dynamic Analysis**
- Modal analysis (natural frequencies)
- Random vibration response
- Shock response spectrum

**Margin Assessment**
- Factors of safety per NASA-STD-5001
- Material allowables and design values
- Ultimate and yield margin calculations

## File Naming

```
21-10-CMP-ANAL_structural_<topic>__r<NN>__<STATUS>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- PDF reports for narratives and summaries
- Excel files for tabulated data
- Reference detailed models in [`../../../CAE/`](../../../CAE/)

## Documentation Requirements

Each analysis report shall include:
1. Objective and scope
2. Analysis method and assumptions
3. Model description (reference to CAE)
4. Results and margins
5. Conclusions and recommendations

## Verification

- Analysis results verified by independent review
- Correlation to test data when applicable
- Model validation documented
- Margins assessed against requirements

## Standards

- **NASA-STD-7009**: Standard for models and simulations
- **ECSS-E-ST-10C**: System engineering general requirements
- Discipline-specific standards as applicable
