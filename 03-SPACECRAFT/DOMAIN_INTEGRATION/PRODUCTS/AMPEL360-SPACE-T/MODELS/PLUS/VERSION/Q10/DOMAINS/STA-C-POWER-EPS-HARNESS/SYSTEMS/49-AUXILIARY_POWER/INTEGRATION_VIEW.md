# 49-AUXILIARY_POWER â€” Integration View

## System Overview

The Auxiliary Power system provides supplementary or alternative power sources for mission-specific requirements. This may include fuel cells, radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG), auxiliary power units (APU), or other specialized power generation equipment.

## Functional Description

This system integrates auxiliary power generation equipment that supplements or replaces primary solar/battery power for specific mission phases or operational scenarios. It provides backup power, peak power augmentation, or sustained power for deep space or high-power missions.

## Key Interfaces

- **06 - Dimensions/Alignments**: Mounting provisions for auxiliary power equipment
- **15 - Environment/Vibration**: Environmental protection and isolation
- **24 - Electrical Power**: Integration with primary EPS
- **31 - Data Handling**: Monitoring and control of auxiliary power systems
- **39 - Power Control Panels**: Power switching and control integration
- **42 - Thermal Control**: Waste heat management and thermal interfaces
- **51 - Primary Structure**: Structural mounting and support
- **97 - Harness/EWIS**: Electrical connections and power distribution

## Operational Modes

- **Standby**: Auxiliary power source on standby, not generating
- **Startup**: Initialization and activation of auxiliary power
- **Active Generation**: Auxiliary power system providing electrical output
- **Parallel Operation**: Auxiliary power operating in parallel with primary EPS
- **Primary Mode**: Auxiliary power as sole power source
- **Shutdown**: Controlled deactivation of auxiliary power system

## Subsystems
