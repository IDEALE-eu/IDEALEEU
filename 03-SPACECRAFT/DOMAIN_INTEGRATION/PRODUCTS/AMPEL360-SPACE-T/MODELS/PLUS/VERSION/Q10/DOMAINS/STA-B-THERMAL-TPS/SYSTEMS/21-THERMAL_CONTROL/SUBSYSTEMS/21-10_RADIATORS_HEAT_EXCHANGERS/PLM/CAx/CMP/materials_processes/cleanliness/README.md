# CLEANLINESS â€” Contamination Control Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains cleanliness verification data including NVR (Non-Volatile Residue) measurements, particle counts, and contamination control logs.

## Contents

- NVR test results (wipe samples)
- Particle count data (size distribution)
- Bake-out logs and verification
- Cleaning procedures and records
- Contamination witness samples
- Handling and storage protocols

### Cleanliness Levels

Typical requirements:
- **Level 100A**: Critical optical surfaces
- **Level 300A**: Thermal control surfaces
- Per IEST-STD-CC1246

### Verification Methods

- Visual inspection under UV light
- Tape lift or wipe sampling
- Particle counting (laser or optical)
- NVR measurement (gravimetric)
