# 30-10 SENSORS – CAx DATA MANAGEMENT

This directory contains authoritative digital engineering artifacts for the dew point and relative humidity sensing subsystem, aligned with the AMPEL360-SPACE-T digital thread.

## CAD (Computer-Aided Design)
- 3D models of sensor mounting configurations
- Interface definitions with thermal protection system (TPS) and structures
- Cable and harness routing geometry
- **Deliverables:** STEP (AP203/214), IGES, annotated PDF drawings

## CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering)
- Thermal analysis of sensor housing under operational and survival environments
- Structural FEM of mounts under launch vibration and quasi-static loads
- Radiation exposure simulations (total ionizing dose, SEE)
- **Non-geometric data:** `CAE/DATA/` (input decks, material libraries, solver logs)

## CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing)
- CNC programs for precision machining of sensor brackets and thermal shunts
- Toolpath definitions for tight-tolerance interfaces
- **Deliverables:** NC code (ISO 6983), manufacturing process plans

## CAI (Computer-Aided Integration)

## CAV (Computer-Aided Validation)
- Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) test environments
- Calibration fixture designs and procedures
- Test scenarios (inputs, pass/fail criteria – *excluding actual test results*)
- **Deliverables:** validation benches, procedure scripts

## CAP (Computer-Aided Process Planning)
- Work instructions for sensor installation, bonding, and grounding
- Bill of Process (BoP) for clean-room integration
- Calibration and checkout procedures (pre-shipment)
