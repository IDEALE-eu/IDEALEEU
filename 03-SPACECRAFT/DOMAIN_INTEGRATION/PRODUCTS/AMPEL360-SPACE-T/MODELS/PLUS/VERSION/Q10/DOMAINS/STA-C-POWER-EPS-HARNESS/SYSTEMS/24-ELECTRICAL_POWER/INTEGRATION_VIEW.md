# 24-ELECTRICAL_POWER â€” Integration View

## System Overview

The Electrical Power System (EPS) provides generation, conditioning, distribution, storage, and protection of electrical power throughout the spacecraft. It ensures reliable power delivery to all spacecraft subsystems under all mission phases and operational modes.

## Functional Description

The EPS integrates solar arrays for power generation, batteries for energy storage, power conditioning and distribution units (PCDU), DC-DC converters, protection devices, and control algorithms to manage power flow and maintain voltage regulation.
