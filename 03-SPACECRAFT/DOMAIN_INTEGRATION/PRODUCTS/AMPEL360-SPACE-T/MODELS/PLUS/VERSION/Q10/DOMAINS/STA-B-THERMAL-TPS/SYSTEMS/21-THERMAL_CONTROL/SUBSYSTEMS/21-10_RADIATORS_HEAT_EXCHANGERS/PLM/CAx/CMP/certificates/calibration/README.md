# CALIBRATION â€” Calibration Certificates

## Purpose

This directory contains calibration certificates for measurement equipment, sensors, and test fixtures used in verification activities.

## Contents

- Sensor calibration certificates (thermocouples, RTDs, pressure)
- Test equipment calibration (multimeters, oscilloscopes)
- Load cell and transducer calibrations
- Fixture and tooling calibrations
- Traceability to NIST or equivalent standards

### Calibration Requirements

- Calibration before use on flight hardware
- Periodic re-calibration per schedule
- Traceability to national/international standards
- Out-of-tolerance notification and corrective action
- Calibration stickers and labels

### Documentation

Each certificate shall include:
1. Equipment identification and serial number
2. Calibration date and due date
3. Calibration standard used
4. As-found and as-left data
5. Uncertainty analysis
6. Technician signature
