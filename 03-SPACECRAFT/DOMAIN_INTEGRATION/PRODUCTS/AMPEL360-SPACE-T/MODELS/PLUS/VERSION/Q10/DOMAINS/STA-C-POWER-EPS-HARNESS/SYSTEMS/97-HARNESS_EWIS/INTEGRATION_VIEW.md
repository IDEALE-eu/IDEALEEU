# 97-HARNESS_EWIS â€” Integration View

## System Overview

The Harness/EWIS (Electrical Wiring Interconnection System) provides all electrical wiring, cables, connectors, and associated hardware for spacecraft electrical connectivity. It ensures reliable signal and power transmission between all spacecraft systems.

## Functional Description

This system integrates the complete electrical wiring infrastructure including main harness backbone, branch looms, connectors, EMI/EMC shielding, cable routing, clamps, labeling, and installation hardware. It provides the physical medium for electrical power distribution and data/signal transmission throughout the spacecraft.

## Key Interfaces

- **06 - Dimensions/Alignments**: Routing paths and connector locations
- **15 - Environment/Vibration**: Cable protection and strain relief
- **24 - Electrical Power**: Power distribution wiring
- **31 - Data Handling**: Data bus and signal wiring
- **39 - Power Control Panels**: Control panel interconnects
- **42 - Thermal Control**: Thermal management of cables and connectors
- **51 - Primary Structure**: Cable routing and mounting provisions
- **57 - Solar Arrays**: Solar array wiring and connectors

## Design Considerations

- **EMI/EMC Compliance**: Shielding and bonding for electromagnetic compatibility
- **Signal Integrity**: Proper cable selection and routing for signal quality
- **Power Capacity**: Wire sizing for current carrying capacity and voltage drop
