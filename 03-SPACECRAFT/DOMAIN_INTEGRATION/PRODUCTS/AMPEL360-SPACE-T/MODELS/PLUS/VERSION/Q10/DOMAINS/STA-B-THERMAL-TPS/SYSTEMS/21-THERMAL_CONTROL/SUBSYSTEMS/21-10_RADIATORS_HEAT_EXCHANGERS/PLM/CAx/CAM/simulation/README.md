# simulation — Simulation & Verification

## Purpose
Verification reports, simulation videos, logs, and collision detection results for all NC programs.

## Contents
- CNC machine simulation files
- Collision detection reports
- Over-travel verification
- Cycle time analysis
- Simulation videos and screenshots
- Verification logs and error reports

## Guidelines
- Mandatory simulation before first cut
- Verify collision-free operation
- Document clearances and near-misses
- Include cycle time estimates
- Verify tool reach and accessibility
- Simulate with actual fixture models
- Document any warnings or alerts
- Re-simulate after any program changes

## File Formats
- Simulation software files (Vericut, NCSimul, etc.)
- `.pdf` — Simulation reports
- `.mp4` / `.avi` — Simulation videos
- `.log` — Verification logs
- `.xlsx` / `.csv` — Cycle time and clearance data
