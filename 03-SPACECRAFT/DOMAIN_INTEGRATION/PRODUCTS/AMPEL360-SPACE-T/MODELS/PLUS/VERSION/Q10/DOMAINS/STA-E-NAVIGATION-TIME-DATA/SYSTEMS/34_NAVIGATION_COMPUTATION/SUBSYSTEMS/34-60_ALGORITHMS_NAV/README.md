## Working with This Subsystem

### Engineers
1. Place design files in appropriate CAx subdirectories
2. Update EBOM_LINKS.md with part numbers and references
3. Follow domain-level naming conventions and standards

### Configuration Management
- All artifacts under version control
- Reference EBOM items in PLM system
- Maintain traceability to requirements
