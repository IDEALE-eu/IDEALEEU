# CAx/README.md (drop-in)

## Scope
Authoritative folders for 21-10 radiators/heat exchangers PLM artifacts. No source code.

## Folders
- **CAD/** – 3D assemblies, drawings, STEP/IGES, GD&T.
- **CAE/** – Thermal balance, radiative cases, FEA, models, results.
- **CAM/** – Toolpaths, fixtures, routing, NC, traveler exports.
- **CAI/** – Installation/assembly work instructions, checklists.
- **CAV/** – TVAC, leak, proof/burst, vibration test setups and evidence.
- **CAP/** – Manufacturing plans, bondline cure schedules, coating processes.
- **CAS/** – Maintenance/inspection manuals, repair limits, service bulletins.
- **CMP/** – Qualification/compliance reports, certificates, trace matrices.

## Conventions
- File IDs: `21-10_<artifact>__rNN__{WIP|RVW|REL}.*`
- Evidence lives in **CMP/**; raw test data in **CAV/**; instructions in **CAI/**.
