# TVAC â€” Thermal Vacuum Test Cases

## Purpose
TVAC (Thermal Vacuum) chamber simulation cases for test prediction and model correlation.

## Contents
- Chamber configuration models
- Shroud temperature profiles
- Heat load simulation setups
- Pre-test predictions
- Test-to-model correlation cases
- Chamber thermal mass effects

## File Organization
- One subdirectory per TVAC test configuration
- Include chamber geometry and properties
- Store shroud temperature schedules
- Document instrumentation mapping

## Naming Convention
```
21-10-CAE_tvac_<test_id>__r<NN>__<STATUS>/
```

Example: `21-10-CAE_tvac_tb_001__r02__REL/`

## Case Requirements
- Model TVAC chamber geometry and shrouds
- Define shroud temperature profiles
- Include chamber thermal mass
- Document heater/cooler simulation
- Reference test procedures (link to CAV)

## CAV Linkage
- Link to test setup documentation in CAV/
- Reference instrumentation plans
- Include correlation methodology
- Document test-specific boundary conditions

## Analysis Outputs
- Pre-test temperature predictions
- Test-to-model comparison
- Correlation factors and uncertainties
- Model validation evidence
- Uncertainty quantification

## Standards
- Follow TVAC test analysis procedures
- Maintain correlation factor documentation
- Link to test data and reports
