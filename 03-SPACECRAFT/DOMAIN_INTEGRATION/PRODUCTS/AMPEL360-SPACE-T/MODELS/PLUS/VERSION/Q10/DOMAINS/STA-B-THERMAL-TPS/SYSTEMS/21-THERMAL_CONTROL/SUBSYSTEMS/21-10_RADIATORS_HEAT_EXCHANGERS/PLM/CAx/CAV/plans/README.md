# PLANS — Test Plans

## Purpose

This directory contains test plans (TP) for radiators, heat exchangers, coldplates, and thermal control hardware testing.

## Contents

Test plans documenting:
- Test objectives and success criteria
- Test methods and procedures
- Acceptance criteria and requirements
- Test matrix and conditions
- Required equipment and facilities
- Safety requirements
- Schedule and milestones

## File Naming Convention

```
TP-21-10-<test-type>__r<NN>__<status>.pdf
```

## Test Plan Requirements

Each test plan should include:
- **Scope**: Hardware to be tested, test types
- **Objectives**: What will be demonstrated/verified
- **Requirements**: Referenced specifications and criteria
- **Methods**: Test approach and methodology
- **Equipment**: Test facilities, chambers, rigs
- **Instrumentation**: Sensors, DAQ systems, channels
- **Procedures**: Reference to detailed procedures
- **Safety**: Hazards, mitigations, PPE requirements
- **Data**: Data collection approach, sample rates
- **Success Criteria**: Pass/fail criteria, margins
- **Schedule**: Test duration, phases, milestones

## Test Types
