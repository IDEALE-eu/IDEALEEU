# THERMAL â€” Thermal Analysis Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains thermal analysis reports including radiator sizing, heat rejection budgets, temperature predictions, and correlation to TVAC test data.

## Contents

This directory includes:
- Radiator sizing calculations and heat rejection budgets
- Temperature distribution analyses
- Thermal margin assessments
- TVAC test correlation reports
- Steady-state and transient thermal analyses
- Thermal interface conductance analyses

### Analysis Types

**Steady-State Analysis**
- Operating mode thermal balance
- Component temperature predictions
- Heat rejection sizing

**Transient Analysis**
- Temperature evolution during orbit
- Worst-case hot/cold scenarios
- Thermal cycling effects

**Correlation Analysis**
- Pre-test predictions vs. test data
- Model calibration and validation
- Uncertainty quantification

## File Naming

```
