# CONFIGURATIONS — Configuration Variants

## Purpose

This directory contains configuration variants of assembly models for the 53_00 Structural Body subsystem. These represent alternative arrangements, simplifications, or optimizations for specific purposes.

## What to Store

- Configuration variants
- Design alternatives
- Simplified models
- Lightweight representations
- Review-specific configurations

## Subdirectories

- [`SIMPLIFIED/`](./SIMPLIFIED/) — Simplified geometry configurations
- [`LIGHTWEIGHT/`](./LIGHTWEIGHT/) — Performance-optimized configurations

## Configuration Types

### Simplified
Geometry simplified for specific analysis or review purposes while maintaining essential characteristics. Useful for:
- FEA preparation
- Design reviews
- Integration studies
- Envelope checks

### Lightweight
Optimized for performance with reduced file size and complexity for fast loading. Useful for:
- Large assembly work
- System-level integration
- Web-based collaboration
- Performance-critical applications

## Usage

Use configurations for:
- Different stakeholder needs
- Performance optimization
- Specific review purposes
- Analysis simplifications
- Progressive detail disclosure

## Related Directories

- [`../TOP_LEVEL/`](../TOP_LEVEL/) — Standard assemblies
- [`../SUB_ASSEMBLIES/`](../SUB_ASSEMBLIES/) — Component assemblies
- [`../../MODELS/`](../../MODELS/) — Source CAD models

## Best Practices

- Document configuration purpose and differences
- Maintain configuration management
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Track configuration relationships
- Validate configurations for intended purpose
