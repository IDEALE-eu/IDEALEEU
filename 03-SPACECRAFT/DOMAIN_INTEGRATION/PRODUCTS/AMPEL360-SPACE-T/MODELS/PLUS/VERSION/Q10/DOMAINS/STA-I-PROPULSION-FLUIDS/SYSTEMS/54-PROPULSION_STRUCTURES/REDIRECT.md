# REDIRECT â€” System 54 Ownership

## System Ownership Note

**System 54 (PROPULSION_STRUCTURES)** may belong to:
- **STA-A (Structures)** if owner is primarily structural
- **STA-I (Propulsion-Fluids)** if owner is propulsion-specific internals

## Redirect Information

If System 54 is owned by **STA-A-STRUCTURES-MECHANISMS**, refer to:
```
../../../STA-A-STRUCTURES-MECHANISMS/SYSTEMS/54-PROPULSION_STRUCTURES/
```

Otherwise, use the local structure in this domain (STA-I-PROPULSION-FLUIDS).

## Coordination

- Coordinate with both STA-A and STA-I teams to determine proper ownership
- Interface matrices should reference both domains where appropriate
- Ensure single source of truth is established per program configuration
