# MSA & SPC â€” 21-10_RADIATORS_HEAT_EXCHANGERS

## Purpose

This directory contains Measurement System Analysis (MSA) studies, Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts, and process capability studies.

## File Organization

- **Gage R&R Studies**: Repeatability and reproducibility analyses (target <10% for critical measurements)
- **Control Charts**: X-bar/R, I-MR, p-charts, and other SPC tools
- **Capability Studies**: Process capability (Cp/Cpk) assessments
- Include SPC reaction plans and out-of-control triggers
- Document measurement procedures and calibration requirements
- Maintain version control through PLM system

## Standards

- Follow AIAG MSA methodology
- Comply with SPC best practices and ECSS quality standards
- Target Gage R&R <10% for critical dimensions; retrain if >30%
- Link to Control Plans and qualification documentation
