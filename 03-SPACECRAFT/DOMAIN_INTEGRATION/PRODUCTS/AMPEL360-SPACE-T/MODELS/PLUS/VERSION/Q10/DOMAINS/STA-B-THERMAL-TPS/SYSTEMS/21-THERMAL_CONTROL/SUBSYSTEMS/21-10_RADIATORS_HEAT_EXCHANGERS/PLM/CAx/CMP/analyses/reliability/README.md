# RELIABILITY â€” Reliability Analysis Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains reliability analyses including Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and criticality assessments.

## Contents

This directory includes:
- FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)
- FTA (Fault Tree Analysis)
- MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) calculations
- Criticality analyses
- Reliability predictions
- Part derating analyses

### Analysis Types

**FMEA**
- Component failure modes
- Effects on subsystem and mission
- Detection methods
- Severity and occurrence ratings
- Risk priority numbers (RPN)

**FTA**
- Top-level failure events
- Contributing failure modes
- Boolean logic models
- Probability calculations

**Reliability Predictions**
- Component failure rates
- Mission reliability
- Redundancy effectiveness

## File Naming

```
21-10-CMP-ANAL_reliability_<topic>__r<NN>__<STATUS>.<ext>
```

Examples:
- PDF reports for narratives and summaries
- Excel files for tabulated data
- Reference detailed models in [`../../../CAE/`](../../../CAE/)

## Documentation Requirements

Each analysis report shall include:
1. Objective and scope
2. Analysis method and assumptions
3. Model description (reference to CAE)
4. Results and margins
5. Conclusions and recommendations

## Verification

- Analysis results verified by independent review
- Correlation to test data when applicable
- Model validation documented
- Margins assessed against requirements

## Standards

- **NASA-STD-7009**: Standard for models and simulations
- **ECSS-E-ST-10C**: System engineering general requirements
- Discipline-specific standards as applicable
