- **ECSS-M:** Management standards
- **ECSS-Q:** Quality assurance standards
- **ECSS-S:** System standards

All STA sets integrate with ECSS requirements for verification, validation, and mission assurance.

## Integration Philosophy

The spacecraft is designed using a top-down integration approach:
1. System-level requirements flow down to STA domain sets
2. Domain sets develop subsystems meeting requirements
3. Cross-system integration ensures compatibility
4. Digital twin validates complete system behavior
5. Final assembly and test executes the physical integration
6. Mission operations provide operational feedback

## Interfaces with Aircraft

Shared technology areas between spacecraft and aircraft programs:
- Materials science (Set A-70 ↔ Aircraft AAA domain)
- Thermal management systems (Set B ↔ Aircraft EER domain)
- Avionics and computing (Sets E, F ↔ Aircraft EDI domain)
- Test facilities and equipment (Set L ↔ Aircraft test infrastructure)
- Propulsion test assets (Set I ↔ Aircraft PPP domain)
- Digital twin models (both programs)
- Configuration management practices
