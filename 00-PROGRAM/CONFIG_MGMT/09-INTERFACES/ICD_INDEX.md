# Interface Control Document (ICD) Index

## Overview

This index catalogs all Interface Control Documents (ICDs) for the IDEALE EU aerospace program. ICDs define and control interfaces between systems, subsystems, components, and external entities.

## Purpose

ICDs ensure:
- Clear definition of interface requirements
- Coordination between interfacing parties
- Configuration control of interfaces
- Traceability of interface changes
- Prevention of interface mismatches

## ICD Numbering

Format: **ICD-[XXXX]**

Where XXXX is a sequential 4-digit number: ICD-0001, ICD-0002, etc.

## ICD Index

| ICD Number | Title | Version | Interface Parties | Status | Owner | Date |
|------------|-------|---------|-------------------|--------|-------|------|
| ICD-0001 | Aircraft-Propulsion System Interface | 1.0 | Airframe ↔ Propulsion | Draft | J. Smith | 2024-01-15 |
| ICD-0002 | Spacecraft-Ground Segment Interface | 1.0 | Spacecraft ↔ Ground Station | Draft | M. Johnson | 2024-01-20 |
| ICD-0003 | Avionics-Flight Control Interface | 1.0 | Avionics ↔ Flight Control | Draft | K. Lee | 2024-01-25 |
| ICD-0004 | Power System Interface | 1.0 | Power Gen ↔ Distribution | Draft | A. Chen | 2024-02-01 |

### External Interfaces
- Aircraft ↔ Ground Support Equipment
- Aircraft ↔ Airport Infrastructure
- Spacecraft ↔ Ground Segment
- Spacecraft ↔ Launch Vehicle
- Vehicle ↔ Test Equipment

### Cross-Program Interfaces
- Aircraft ↔ Spacecraft (shared technology)
- Design ↔ Manufacturing
- Engineering ↔ Operations

## ICD Development Process

1. **Identify Interface** - Systems engineering identifies interface need
2. **Assign ICD Number** - Configuration Management assigns ICD number
3. **Develop ICD** - Interface parties draft ICD using template
4. **Review** - Technical review by stakeholders
5. **Approval** - CCB approves ICD
6. **Release** - CM releases ICD and places under configuration control
7. **Maintain** - Changes processed through ECR/ECO

## ICD Template

See **ICD-XXXX.md** template in this directory.

## ICD Status Definitions

- **Draft** - In development, not yet approved
- **Review** - Under review by stakeholders
- **Approved** - Approved by CCB, under configuration control
- **Active** - Currently in use
- **Superseded** - Replaced by newer version
- **Obsolete** - No longer applicable

## Interface Control Working Groups (ICWG)

For complex interfaces, establish ICWGs:
- Regular meetings between interface parties
- Resolve interface issues
- Coordinate interface changes
- Report to systems engineering and CCB

## Change Control

All changes to approved ICDs require:
1. Engineering Change Request (ECR)
2. Impact assessment by both interface parties
3. CCB approval
4. Implementation coordination
5. Verification of interface compatibility

## Traceability

ICDs linked to:
- System requirements (10-TRACEABILITY/REQ_ITEM.csv)
- Interface requirements
- Design documents
- Test procedures
- Configuration items

## Documentation Storage

- Active ICDs: This directory (09-INTERFACES/)
- Superseded ICDs: Archive with version history
- Supporting documents: Linked in each ICD

## ICD Metrics

Track and report:
- Number of active ICDs
- ICDs in draft/review status
- Interface-related ECRs
- Interface discrepancies/issues
- ICD review cycle time

## Governance

- ICD authority: Systems Engineering and Configuration Management
- ICD approval: CCB
- ICD maintenance: Interface parties with CM support
- Quarterly review of ICD index
