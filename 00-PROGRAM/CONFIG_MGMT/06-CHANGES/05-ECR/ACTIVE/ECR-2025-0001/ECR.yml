# CHANGE CLASSIFICATION
classification: Class I
priority: High

# AFFECTED ITEMS
affected_items:
  - part_number: "WING-SPAR-001"
    description: "Main wing spar"
    current_revision: "Rev A"
    proposed_revision: "Rev B"

# CHANGE DESCRIPTION
change_description:
  problem_statement: |
    Current wing spar material (Al 7075-T6) shows marginal fatigue life
    under expected operating conditions. Analysis indicates potential
    for fatigue cracks at high-cycle loading.
    
  proposed_solution: |
    Change wing spar material from Al 7075-T6 to Al 7050-T7451.
    Al 7050-T7 offers superior fatigue resistance and improved
    stress corrosion cracking resistance.
    
  justification: |
    - Improved fatigue life (50% increase)
    - Better stress corrosion resistance
    - Similar machinability and cost
    - Meets all structural requirements
    
  alternatives_considered: |
    1. Keep Al 7075-T6, increase inspection frequency
    2. Titanium alloy (rejected due to cost)
    3. Al 7050-T7 (selected)
