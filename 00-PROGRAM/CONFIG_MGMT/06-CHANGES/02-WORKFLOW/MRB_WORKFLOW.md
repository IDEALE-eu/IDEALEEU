# Material Review Board (MRB) Workflow

> Location: `CONFIG_MGMT/06-CHANGES/02-WORKFLOW/MRB_WORKFLOW.md`  
> Authority: Quality Manager

## Purpose

Define the Material Review Board process for dispositioning non-conforming material.

## Overview

The Material Review Board (MRB) reviews non-conforming hardware, software, or documentation and determines disposition. This process is closely linked to the NCR/CAPA system in **[../../QUALITY_QMS/06-NCR_CAPA/](../../QUALITY_QMS/06-NCR_CAPA/)**.

## Disposition Options

### 1. Use-As-Is
Accept non-conforming item without rework.

### 2. Rework
Bring item into conformance with original requirements.

### 3. Repair
Make item functional but not necessarily to original specification.

### 4. Scrap
Reject item, remove from inventory.
