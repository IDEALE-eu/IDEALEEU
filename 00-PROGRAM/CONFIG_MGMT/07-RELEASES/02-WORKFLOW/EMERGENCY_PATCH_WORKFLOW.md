# Emergency Patch Workflow

**Document Number:** CM-WF-EMERGENCY  
**Revision:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-01

## 1. Purpose

Defines the expedited workflow for releasing emergency patches to address critical safety, security, or operational issues requiring immediate deployment.

## 2. Scope

Applies to emergency patches only. For standard releases, see [RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md](./RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md).

## 3. When to Use Emergency Patch

Emergency patch is appropriate when:
- **Critical safety hazard** identified in operational configuration
- **Security vulnerability** actively exploited or publicly disclosed
- **Loss of essential function** affecting safety or mission success
- **Regulatory mandate** (Airworthiness Directive, Emergency Order)

Emergency patch is **NOT** appropriate for:
- Planned updates or enhancements
- Non-critical bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Feature requests

**Decision Authority:** Safety Manager (for safety), Security Officer (for security), or Configuration Manager (for operational).

## 4. Severity Classification

### 4.1 Critical (Deploy within 24 hours)

**Criteria:**
- Immediate threat to life or spacecraft
- Security vulnerability actively exploited
- Total loss of critical function
- Regulatory emergency order

**Examples:**
- Flight control software bug causing uncommanded behavior
- Cybersecurity breach in avionics network
- Structural failure risk requiring immediate inspection
- Propulsion system malfunction

**Authority:** Program Manager + Safety Manager (if safety-related)

### 4.2 High (Deploy within 72 hours)

**Criteria:**
- Potential safety issue (hazard identified but not yet manifested)
- Security vulnerability disclosed but not yet exploited
- Major operational impact (degraded but not lost capability)
- Airworthiness Directive (AD) with short compliance time

**Examples:**
- Software defect that could lead to unsafe condition
- Unpatched CVE with known exploit available
- Sensor degradation affecting redundancy
- Time-limited AD compliance

**Authority:** Safety Manager (if safety-related) or Configuration Manager

### 4.3 Medium (Deploy within 7 days)

**Criteria:**
- Degraded safety margin
- Security risk but no immediate threat
- Significant operational limitation
- Standard AD compliance

**Examples:**
- Reduced fault tolerance
- Security vulnerability with no known exploit
- Performance degradation
- Routine AD

**Authority:** Configuration Manager
