# Configuration Management (CONFIG_MGMT)

## Overview

This directory contains all configuration management documentation, processes, and artifacts for the IDEALE EU aerospace program. Configuration management ensures systematic control of product configuration throughout the lifecycle, maintaining consistency, traceability, and integrity.

## Purpose

The configuration management system provides:
- Unique identification of all configuration items
- Baseline management across program milestones
- Change control processes (ECR/ECO)
- Requirements and change traceability
- Interface control documentation
- Version control and release management

## Contents

- **01-CM_PLAN.md** - Configuration Management Plan
- **02-PART_NUMBERING.md** - Part numbering scheme and conventions
- **03-SERIALIZATION.md** - Serialization guidelines for production items
- **04-BASELINES/** - Baseline snapshots at each stage gate (SRR, PDR, CDR, TRR, PRR, ORR_EIS, FRR)
- **05-CCB/** - Configuration Control Board charter, members, and meeting minutes
- **06-CHANGES/** - Engineering Change Requests (ECR), Change Orders (ECO), Deviations, and Waivers
- **07-RELEASES/** - Release packages for Aircraft and Spacecraft
- **08-ITEM_MASTER/** - Master list of configuration items with attributes

- **12-CI_CD_RULES/** - Continuous Integration/Deployment rules, branching model, tagging conventions
- **13-TEMPLATES/** - Standard templates for ECR, ECO, and other CM documents

## Key Standards

- **AS9100** - Quality Management System for Aerospace
- **ARP4754A** - Guidelines for Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems (Aircraft)
- **ECSS-M-ST-40C** - Configuration and Information Management (Spacecraft)
- **ISO 10007** - Configuration Management Guidelines

## Workflow

1. **Identification** - Assign unique part numbers and maintain item master
2. **Baseline** - Establish baselines at stage gates
3. **Change Control** - Process changes through CCB using ECR/ECO
4. **Traceability** - Maintain links between requirements, items, and changes
5. **Audit** - Conduct configuration and functional audits
6. **Release** - Package and release approved configurations

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Configuration Manager** - Overall CM system ownership
- **CCB Chair** - Lead change control board meetings
- **CCB Members** - Review and approve changes
- **Engineering** - Submit ECRs, implement ECOs
- **Quality** - Audit configuration compliance
- **Manufacturing** - Implement released configurations
