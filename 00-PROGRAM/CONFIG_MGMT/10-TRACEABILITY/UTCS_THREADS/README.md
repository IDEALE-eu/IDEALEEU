# Use Case Test Case System (UTCS) Threads

This directory contains UTCS threads that provide end-to-end traceability from use cases through test cases to system verification.

## Purpose

UTCS threads enable:
- Traceability from operational scenarios to system requirements
- Test coverage verification
- Requirements validation
- System verification planning
- Gap analysis

## Thread Structure

Each UTCS thread documents:
1. **Use Case** - Operational scenario or mission phase
2. **Requirements** - System and subsystem requirements derived from use case
3. **Test Cases** - Test scenarios that verify the requirements
4. **System Elements** - Configuration items involved
5. **Verification Status** - Current status of verification

## Naming Convention

Thread files should be named: `UTCS-[ID]-[NAME].md`

**Examples:**
- `UTCS-001-AIRCRAFT-TAKEOFF.md`
- `UTCS-002-SPACECRAFT-LAUNCH.md`
- `UTCS-003-NOMINAL-CRUISE.md`
