# GenSTD-II: Multi-Domain Standards

## Overview

**GenSTD-II** represents multi-domain standards that integrate Configuration Management, Quality Assurance, and Security requirements. This is the second tier of GenSTD standardization.

## Purpose

GenSTD-II baselines are:
- Built on proven GenSTD-I foundations
- Validated across CM, QA, and Security domains
- Ready for broader organizational deployment
- Cross-functional and integrated

## Characteristics

- **Source**: GenSTD-I baselines (promoted)
- **Approval**: CAB + QA + Security sign-off required
- **Scope**: Multi-domain integration (CM + QA + Security minimum)
- **Stability**: High - changes require cross-domain review
- **EHC**: Full compliance mandatory

## Placement Criteria

A baseline qualifies for GenSTD-II when:
- [ ] Built on approved GenSTD-I baseline
- [ ] CM validation complete
- [ ] QA validation complete
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Multi-domain integration documented
- [ ] Cross-functional testing completed
- [ ] All EHC artifacts updated for multi-domain context

## Multi-Domain Integration

GenSTD-II must address:

### Configuration Management
- Version control and traceability
- Change management procedures
- Baseline identification and control
- Configuration audits

### Quality Assurance
- Quality requirements verification
- Testing and validation evidence
- Non-conformance handling
- Quality metrics

### Security
- Security requirements compliance
- Vulnerability assessment
- Access control specifications
- Security testing results

## Usage

GenSTD-II baselines are used for:
- Organization-wide deployments
- Production systems
- Cross-functional programs
- Integration with external systems

## Transition Path

GenSTD-II baselines can progress to GenSTD-III through:
1. Regulatory compliance verification
2. Certification authority engagement
3. Industry standards alignment
4. Formal compliance matrix completion
