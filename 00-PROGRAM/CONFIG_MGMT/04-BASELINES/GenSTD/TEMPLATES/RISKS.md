## Risk Rating Scale

| Level | Impact | Likelihood | Score |
|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| **Critical** | Catastrophic | Very Likely | 16-25 |
| **High** | Major | Likely | 10-15 |
| **Medium** | Moderate | Possible | 5-9 |
| **Low** | Minor | Unlikely | 1-4 |

**Risk Score** = Impact (1-5) × Likelihood (1-5)

## Risk Acceptance

### Criteria for Acceptance

Residual risks are acceptable if:
- Critical risks (16-25): Reduced to ≤15
- High risks (10-15): Reduced to ≤9
- Medium risks (5-9): Mitigations documented
- Low risks (1-4): Accepted as-is

### Overall Risk Posture

**Total Initial Risk**: [Sum of initial scores]  
**Total Residual Risk**: [Sum of residual scores]  
**Risk Reduction**: [Percentage reduction]

**Assessment**: [Overall risk is Acceptable / Needs further mitigation]

---

## Risk Monitoring

### Review Frequency

- **Critical/High risks**: Weekly review
- **Medium risks**: Monthly review
- **Low risks**: Quarterly review

### Triggers for Re-assessment

- [ ] Significant baseline changes
- [ ] New information discovered
- [ ] Mitigation strategies fail
- [ ] External conditions change
- [ ] Regulatory requirements update

## Example Risks (for reference)

### Example: Material Embrittlement at Cryogenic Temperatures

**ID**: R-001  
**Category**: Technical / Safety  
**Status**: Active

**Description**:
Aluminum alloys may experience unexpected embrittlement when exposed to -253°C LH2, potentially leading to structural failure of tank walls under stress cycling.

**Impact**: 5 (Catastrophic - potential tank rupture)  
**Likelihood**: 3 (Possible - limited flight test data)  
**Initial Risk Score**: 15 (High)

**Consequences if realized**:
- Tank structural failure
- LH2 leak (fire/explosion hazard)
- Aircraft loss
- Regulatory grounding of fleet

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. Conduct extensive material testing at -253°C with stress cycling
2. Implement 2× safety factor in structural margins
3. Real-time strain monitoring on first 5 production aircraft
4. Quarterly inspections of critical weld joints
5. Alternative material (titanium alloy) qualified as backup

**Residual Risk**:
- **Impact**: 5 (still catastrophic if occurs)
- **Likelihood**: 1 (unlikely after extensive testing)
- **Residual Score**: 5 (Medium)
- **Acceptable**: Yes - Reduced to medium through comprehensive testing and monitoring

**Owner**: Dr. Maria Santos, Cryogenics Lead  
**Target Date**: 2025-12-31  
**Status**: In Progress (80% complete)
