# GenSTD-III: Regulatory Baselines

## Overview

**GenSTD-III** represents regulatory and compliance-aligned reference baselines. This is the third tier of GenSTD standardization, focused on certification and regulatory approval.

## Purpose

GenSTD-III baselines are:
- Aligned with regulatory requirements
- Certification-ready
- Compliance-verified
- Suitable for regulatory submission

## Characteristics

- **Source**: GenSTD-II baselines (promoted)
- **Approval**: CAB + QA + Security + Compliance + Regulatory Authority engagement
- **Scope**: Full regulatory compliance
- **Stability**: Very high - changes require regulatory review
- **EHC**: Full compliance mandatory with regulatory focus

## Placement Criteria

A baseline qualifies for GenSTD-III when:
- [ ] Built on approved GenSTD-II baseline
- [ ] Regulatory requirements mapped and verified
- [ ] Compliance matrix complete
- [ ] Certification plan approved
- [ ] Regulatory authority engaged (if required)
- [ ] Industry standards compliance documented
- [ ] All EHC artifacts include regulatory context

## Regulatory Alignment

GenSTD-III must address applicable regulations such as:

### Aviation (Aircraft)
- EASA CS-25, CS-23 (Airworthiness)
- FAA 14 CFR Part 25, Part 23
- EASA SC-H2 (Hydrogen aircraft)
- ARP4754A (Development)
- DO-178C (Software)
- DO-254 (Hardware)
- DO-160 (Environmental)

### Space (Spacecraft/Satellites)
- ECSS (European Cooperation for Space Standardization)
- NASA standards
- ITU regulations (for satellites)

### Cross-Cutting
- ISO 9001 (Quality Management)
- AS9100 (Aerospace QMS)
- ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security)
- GDPR (Data Protection)
- ITAR / EAR (Export control)

## Compliance Documentation

GenSTD-III baselines must include:

1. **Compliance Matrix**: Mapping requirements to evidence
2. **Certification Plan**: Strategy and schedule
3. **Verification Reports**: Test results and analyses
4. **Safety Assessment**: Hazard analysis and risk mitigation
5. **Quality Records**: Audit trails and reviews
6. **Regulatory Correspondence**: Letters, meetings, findings

## Usage

GenSTD-III baselines are used for:
- Type certification submissions
- Regulatory approval applications
- Airworthiness/spaceworthiness certification
- Compliance demonstrations
- Regulatory audits

## Transition Path

GenSTD-III baselines can progress to GenSTD-IV through:
1. Industry-wide adoption
2. Standards body engagement (e.g., SAE, ISO)
3. CSDB harmonization
4. Multi-organization alignment

## Certification Process

Typical flow for GenSTD-III:

1. **Preparation** (GenSTD-II → III)
   - Map regulatory requirements
   - Complete compliance matrix
   - Prepare certification plan

2. **Authority Engagement**
   - Initial meeting with EASA/FAA/etc.
   - Present certification plan
   - Address questions and concerns

3. **Validation**
   - Execute verification plan
   - Document all evidence
   - Internal audits

4. **Submission**
   - Formal application
   - Evidence packages
   - Supporting documentation

5. **Approval**
   - Authority review and findings
   - Address findings
   - Receive approval/certificate
