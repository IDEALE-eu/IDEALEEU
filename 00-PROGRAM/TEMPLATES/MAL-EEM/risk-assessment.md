|-----------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| HAZ-001 | [Description] | [Condition] | [Harm] |
| HAZ-002 | [Description] | [Condition] | [Harm] |

**Hazard Analysis**: [Link to detailed hazard analysis]

## 3. Risk Assessment

### Risk Matrix
For each identified hazard:

| Hazard ID | Likelihood | Severity | Risk Level | Acceptability |
|-----------|-----------|----------|------------|---------------|
| HAZ-001 | Rare/Unlikely/Possible/Likely/Certain | Negligible/Minor/Moderate/Major/Catastrophic | Low/Medium/High/Critical | Acceptable/ALARP/Unacceptable |

### Risk Scoring
- **Likelihood Scale**: 
  - Rare (1), Unlikely (2), Possible (3), Likely (4), Certain (5)
- **Severity Scale**: 
  - Negligible (1), Minor (2), Moderate (3), Major (4), Catastrophic (5)
- **Risk Level**: Likelihood Ã— Severity
  - Low (1-4), Medium (5-9), High (10-15), Critical (16-25)
