# Asset Identification and Tagging

## Overview

Standards for uniquely identifying and tagging company-owned assets at supplier locations.

## Asset Identification System

### Asset ID Structure
**Format:** AST-####
- "AST" = Asset prefix
- "####" = Sequential 4-digit number
- Example: AST-0001, AST-0123

**Characteristics:**
- Unique identifier for each asset
- Permanent (does not change with location or supplier)
- Traceable in asset register
- Links to acquisition, maintenance, and disposition records

### Alternative Schemes
- By asset type: TOOL-####, GAGE-####, SW-#### (software)
- By program: PROG-AST-####
- Bar code or QR code for scanning

## Physical Tagging

### Tag Requirements
- Durable material (metal, permanent label)
- Legible asset ID
- Company name or logo
- Contact information (phone, email)
- Bar code or QR code (optional but recommended)
- Weather and chemical resistant

### Tag Placement
- Visible location on asset
- Permanent attachment (rivets, adhesive, engraving)
- Not obstructing operation or maintenance
- Multiple locations for large assets (primary and secondary)

### Tag Examples

**Metal Tag (engraved or etched):**
```
Company Name
Asset ID: AST-0123
Contact: +1-555-1234
```

**Label with Bar Code:**
```
Company Logo
Asset ID: AST-0123
[Barcode]
```
