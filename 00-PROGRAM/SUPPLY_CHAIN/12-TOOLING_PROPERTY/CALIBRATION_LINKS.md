# Calibration Requirements

## Overview

Calibration requirements for measuring and test equipment ensure accuracy and traceability.

## Calibration Standards

### ISO/IEC 17025
- Accredited calibration laboratories
- Competence and quality management
- Traceability to national/international standards

### AS9100 Requirements
- Calibration program for inspection, measuring, and test equipment
- Defined intervals and procedures
- Records and traceability
- Out-of-tolerance procedures

## Calibration Process

### Equipment Identification
- Unique calibration ID
- Marked or labeled on equipment
- Calibration status visible

### Calibration Schedule
- Based on equipment type, usage, stability, manufacturer recommendations
- Typical intervals: 6 months to 2 years
- More frequent if critical or history of drift

### Calibration Execution
- Performed by qualified laboratory (internal or external)
- As-found and as-left data recorded
- Adjustments and repairs documented
- Certificate of calibration issued

### Traceability
- NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
- International standards (SI units)
- Chain of traceability documented
- Uncertainty of measurement reported

## Calibration Records

### Certificate of Calibration
- Equipment identification and serial number
- Calibration date and due date
- Standards used (with traceability)
- As-found and as-left readings
- Adjustments made
- Measurement uncertainty
- Calibration lab and technician
- Accreditation information

### Record Retention
- Retain calibration records for life of equipment or per quality system requirements
- Electronic database or file system
- Accessible for audits and reviews

## Out-of-Tolerance Procedures

### Discovery
- Equipment found out-of-tolerance during calibration
- Immediate notification to quality and affected users

### Impact Assessment
- Identify measurements taken since last calibration
- Assess potential impact on product quality
- Determine if nonconforming product produced

### Corrective Action
- Quarantine or replace equipment
- Re-inspect affected products (if necessary)
- Investigate root cause of drift
- Corrective action to prevent recurrence
- Document findings and actions

## Supplier Calibration Requirements

### Company-Owned Equipment at Supplier
- Supplier calibrates per agreed schedule
- Calibration to same standards as company equipment
- Certificates provided to company
- Company audit rights

### Supplier-Owned Equipment
- Supplier maintains calibration program
- Evidence of calibration during audits
- Certificates available for review
- Non-calibrated equipment not used for acceptance inspection

## Calibration Alerts

### Due Date Tracking
- Monitor calibration due dates
- Alerts 30 days before due
- Do not use equipment past due date
- Expedite calibration if critical

### Overdue Equipment
- Remove from service immediately
- Tag as out-of-calibration
- Assess impact on recent measurements
- Expedite calibration or replace
