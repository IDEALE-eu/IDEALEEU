# Conflict Minerals Compliance

## Overview

Due diligence and reporting on conflict minerals per Dodd-Frank Act Section 1502 and OECD guidance.

## Conflict Minerals (3TG)

### Covered Minerals
1. **Tin (Sn)** and derivatives (cassiterite)
2. **Tantalum (Ta)** and derivatives (coltan)
3. **Tungsten (W)** and derivatives (wolframite)
4. **Gold (Au)**

### Covered Countries
- Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
- Adjoining countries (Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Congo Republic, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia)

## Extended Minerals

### Additional Focus
- **Cobalt** - Battery and electronics applications
- **Mica** - Electronics and cosmetics
- Other minerals as identified (lithium, rare earths)

## Due Diligence Process

### Step 1: Determine Applicability
- Does product contain 3TG?
- Are minerals necessary to functionality or production?
- Source or origin determination required

### Step 2: Supplier Inquiry
- Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT)
- Request smelter and refiner information
- Validate responses
- Follow up on incomplete responses

### Step 3: Smelter Validation
- Cross-reference with Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) lists
- Confirm smelters are validated/conformant
- Identify non-conformant smelters
- Engage suppliers for sourcing changes

### Step 4: Risk Assessment
- Evaluate supply chain risks
- Identify high-risk smelters or regions
- Document risk mitigation actions
- Management review

### Step 5: Reporting
- Prepare Form SD and Conflict Minerals Report (if required)
- Disclosure of findings
- Independent private sector audit (if "not DRC conflict-free")
- File with SEC (for public companies)

## Supplier Requirements

### Annual CMRT Submission
- Complete Conflict Minerals Reporting Template
- Declare 3TG presence
- Identify smelters and refiners
- Country of origin information
- Due diligence measures

### Extended Minerals Reporting
- Cobalt reporting template
- Mica sourcing information
- Other minerals as requested

### Continuous Improvement
- Work toward conflict-free supply chain
- Source from validated smelters
- Support artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) improvements
- Industry collaboration

## Responsible Sourcing Initiatives

### Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)
- Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP)
- Validated smelters and refiners list
- Audit protocols
- Industry standards

### OECD Due Diligence Guidance
- 5-step framework
- Supply chain transparency
- Risk identification and mitigation
- Independent third-party audit
- Annual reporting

## Documentation and Records
- CMRT archives (annual)
- Smelter validation documents
- Risk assessments
- Supplier responses
- Communications and escalations
- Management reviews
- Corrective actions
