# Receiving Procedures

## Overview

Standard procedures for receiving incoming materials and products.

## Receiving Process

### 1. Pre-Receipt Activities
**Advance Shipping Notice (ASN):**
- Review ASN from supplier or carrier
- Verify against open purchase orders
- Plan receiving resources
- Coordinate inspection if required
- Prepare receiving location

**Dock Scheduling:**
- Coordinate carrier arrival time
- Allocate dock door and personnel
- Special equipment needs (forklift, crane)
- Hazmat handling requirements

### 2. Physical Receipt

**Unloading:**
- Safety checks and dock leveler positioning
- Verify carrier and shipment identification
- Unload per handling instructions
- Use appropriate material handling equipment
- Visual inspection for damage

**Documentation:**
- Obtain packing slip, bill of lading, commercial invoice
- Verify shipment identity (PO number, supplier, carrier)
- Count packages and verify against documents
- Note any discrepancies or damage on carrier receipt

**Initial Inspection:**
- Package integrity (no damage, seal intact)
- Proper labeling and markings
- Hazmat or special handling labels
- Temperature sensitive materials (if applicable)
- ITAR markings (if applicable)

### 3. Quantity Verification

**Package Count:**
- Verify number of packages against documents
- Compare to PO quantity
- Note shortages or overages

**Contents Verification:**
- Open packages (unless tamper-evident seal for quality inspection)
- Count individual items
- Verify part numbers match PO and labels
- Check for concealed damage

**Discrepancy Resolution:**
- Document shortages, overages, damages
- Photograph evidence if significant
- Notify carrier immediately for visible damage
- Notify supplier for shortages/wrong parts
- Quarantine discrepant material

### 4. Documentation Review

**Required Documents:**
- Packing list (verify completeness)
- Certificate of Conformance (CoC) - verify part numbers, quantities
- Test reports or inspection data (if specified)
- Material certifications (if specified)
- MSDS/SDS for hazardous materials
- Export/import documentation
- ITAR or export control documentation

**Document Verification:**
- All required documents present
- Part numbers and quantities match
- Revision levels correct (check against engineering specs)
- Supplier authorized signatory
- Traceability information (lot, batch, serial numbers)

**Missing or Incorrect Documents:**
- Contact supplier immediately
- Quarantine material until resolved
- Obtain correct documentation
- Do not process receipt until complete

### 5. System Transaction

**Receiving Transaction:**
- Create goods receipt in ERP system
- Enter PO number and line items
- Confirm quantities received
- Assign receiving document number
- Attach or link supporting documents
- Update inventory and PO status

**Location Assignment:**
- Receiving location (temporary)
- Quarantine (if awaiting inspection)
- Conforming stock location (after inspection)
- Consignment location (if VMI/consignment)

**Labeling:**
- Apply internal tracking labels (barcode/RFID)
- Receiving identification number
- Storage location code
- Inspection status (awaiting, accepted, rejected)

### 6. Inspection Routing

**Quality Inspection Requirements:**
- Review inspection requirements (first article, sampling, 100%)
- Route to inspection area
- Notify quality inspection team
- Hold in quarantine until released
- Do not issue to production until approved

**Inspection Levels:**
- **No Inspection Required:** Direct receipt to stock
- **Reduced Inspection:** Supplier has excellent performance, sample check
- **Normal Inspection:** Standard sampling per plan
- **100% Inspection:** New supplier, history of issues, critical characteristics
- **First Article Inspection (FAI):** First production or after changes

### 7. Acceptance or Rejection

**Acceptance:**
- Quality releases material
- Move from quarantine to active stock
- Update inventory status (available)
- Notify planning/procurement
- Invoice processing can proceed

**Rejection:**
- Quality rejects material (nonconforming)
- Quarantine and label as rejected
- Issue nonconformance report (NCR)
- Notify supplier - SCAR or return authorization
- Disposition (return, scrap, use-as-is, rework)
- Update inventory and PO

### 8. Special Handling

**ITAR/Export Controlled:**
- Verify authorization for receipt
- Secure storage area with access controls
- Mark material and location as ITAR
- Limited access per authorization
- Track personnel access

**Hazmat:**
- Verify proper labeling and documentation
- SDS available and accessible
- Store per requirements (segregation, ventilation, temperature)
- Train personnel on handling
- Emergency equipment available

**Temperature Sensitive:**
- Monitor temperature during receipt
- Verify temperature indicators (if present)
- Immediate transfer to controlled storage
- Document temperature history

**ESD Sensitive:**
- Anti-static packaging intact
- Handle in ESD-controlled area
- Use ESD protection (wrist straps, mats)
- Store in ESD-safe location

## Performance Metrics

### Key Metrics
- **Receiving Cycle Time:** Time from dock to system receipt
- **Receiving Accuracy:** Qty/part number errors per receipt
- **Damage Rate:** Damaged shipments / total shipments
- **Document Completeness:** Complete documents / total receipts
- **Inspection Turnaround:** Time from receipt to inspection complete

### Continuous Improvement
- Root cause analysis of errors and damage
- Supplier feedback and development
- Process improvements
- Technology adoption (barcoding, automation)
- Training and competency
