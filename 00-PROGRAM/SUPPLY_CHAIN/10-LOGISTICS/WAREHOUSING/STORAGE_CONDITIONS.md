# Storage Conditions

## Overview

Requirements for proper storage of materials including environmental controls, segregation, and shelf life management.

## Environmental Controls

### Temperature and Humidity

**Standard Materials:**
- Temperature: 15-25°C (59-77°F)
- Relative Humidity: 30-70%
- Typical warehouse ambient conditions

**Temperature Sensitive:**
- Adhesives, sealants: May require refrigeration (2-8°C)
- Composites: Temperature controlled (15-25°C), low humidity (<50%)
- Elastomers: Cool storage (10-20°C)
- Batteries: Per manufacturer specifications, avoid extreme heat
- Chemicals: Per MSDS/SDS requirements

**Frozen Storage:**
- Certain adhesives, biological materials
- -18°C to -20°C (0°F to -4°F)
- Freezer storage with alarms

**Monitoring:**
- Temperature and humidity sensors
- Data logging and trending
- Alarm for out-of-range conditions
- Regular calibration of sensors
- Documented response to excursions

### Light and UV Protection
- Sensitive materials protected from direct sunlight and UV
- Opaque or UV-blocking packaging
- Warehouse lighting (avoid UV-rich sources)
- Materials: Composites, plastics, adhesives, coatings

### Cleanliness and Contamination Control
- Clean, dry, pest-free environment
- Regular housekeeping
- No food or drink in storage areas
- Contamination prevention for clean parts (aerospace)
- FOD (Foreign Object Debris) control for aerospace/space

## Segregation and Zoning

### Conforming vs. Nonconforming
- **Conforming Stock:** Approved for use, green zone
- **Quarantine/Awaiting Inspection:** Yellow zone, hold for inspection
- **Nonconforming/Rejected:** Red zone, segregated, clearly marked
- Physical barriers or clear separation
- Access controls to prevent mixing

### Hazardous Materials
- Separate storage per hazard class
- Segregation per compatibility (flammables vs. oxidizers)
- Adequate ventilation
- Fire suppression and containment
- MSDS/SDS accessible
- Emergency equipment (eyewash, spill kits)

### ITAR/Export Controlled
- Secure storage area with access controls
- Personnel access logged
- Clearly marked as ITAR or export controlled
- Separate from non-controlled items
- Compliance with Technology Control Plan

### ESD Sensitive
- ESD-protected area (grounded flooring, benches)
- Anti-static shelving and containers
- ESD signage
- Personnel grounding when handling
- Monitoring of ESD controls

### High-Value Items
- Secure cage or room
- Limited access (key or card control)
- Inventory tracking and accountability
- Insurance and risk management

## Shelf Life Management

### Shelf Life Definition
- **Limited Shelf Life:** Materials that degrade over time
- **Examples:** Adhesives, sealants, paints, coatings, elastomers, batteries, filters

### Shelf Life Tracking
- Receive date recorded in system
- Expiration date calculated (manufacture date + shelf life)
- FEFO (First Expired First Out) enforcement
- Periodic review and reporting
- Alerts for approaching expiration

### Handling Expired Materials
- Quarantine expired material
- Notify engineering and quality
- Options:
  - **Re-test and extend:** Supplier re-certifies remaining shelf life
  - **Scrap/Dispose:** If no longer usable
  - **Use-as-is:** Engineering approval for specific application with justification
- Document disposition and approvals

### Shelf Life by Material Type

**Adhesives and Sealants:**
- Typical shelf life: 6-12 months refrigerated
- Strict FEFO enforcement
- Temperature excursions may reduce shelf life

**Composites (Prepreg):**
- Typical shelf life: 6-18 months frozen
- Out-time (time at room temp) also tracked
- Critical for aerospace applications

**Paints and Coatings:**
- Typical shelf life: 12-24 months
- Mix ratios and pot life also important

**O-Rings and Seals:**
- Typical shelf life: 5-10 years (depending on material)
- Store in original packaging, cool, dark

**Filters and Absorbents:**
- Shelf life per manufacturer
- Moisture and contamination sensitive

## Storage Best Practices

### Stock Rotation
- FIFO (First In First Out) for non-expiring materials
- FEFO (First Expired First Out) for shelf life items
- Lot control for traceability
- Avoid dead stock accumulation

### Handling and Protection
- Use appropriate material handling equipment
- Avoid stacking damage (weight limits, fragile items)
- Original packaging retained when possible
- Repackage with appropriate protection if opened
- Protect from moisture (desiccants, sealed bags)

### Labeling
- Clear identification of material
- Part number, description, quantity
- Lot or serial number (traceability)
- Expiration date (if shelf life limited)
- Inspection status
- Location barcode or identifier

### Inventory Accuracy
- Cycle counting program
- Perpetual inventory system
- Investigate and resolve discrepancies
- Physical security to prevent loss or theft

### Documentation
- Storage requirements documented and accessible
- Procedures and work instructions
- Training records for personnel
- Environmental monitoring records
- Shelf life tracking and disposition records

## Special Storage Requirements

### Space Hardware (Spacecraft Parts)
- **Cleanroom or controlled environment** for contamination-sensitive items
- **ESD protection** for electronics
- **Desiccated storage** for moisture-sensitive
- **Nitrogen purge** for some hermetic devices
- **Serialized tracking** and traceability
- **Limited access** and handling procedures
- **Storage environmental log** for audit trail

### Flight-Critical Components
- Heightened security and access controls
- Enhanced traceability
- Regular inventory audits
- Documentation of all handling
- Special handling procedures

## Continuous Improvement

### Performance Monitoring
- Shelf life expiry rate (target: <1% expired before use)
- Inventory accuracy (target: >98%)
- Storage space utilization
- Environmental excursions (target: zero or minimal)
- Material damage rate

### Process Improvement
- Review storage procedures regularly
- Technology adoption (automated storage, RFID)
- Supplier packaging improvements
- Lean warehouse principles
- Employee training and awareness
