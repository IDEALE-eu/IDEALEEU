# Incoterms

## Overview

International Commercial Terms (Incoterms) define responsibilities between buyer and seller for delivery, risk, and costs.

## Common Incoterms for Supply Chain

### EXW (Ex Works)
**Seller's Obligation:** Minimum - Make goods available at their premises
**Buyer's Responsibility:** All transport, export/import, insurance, risk from pickup
**Use Case:** Buyer has strong logistics capability; Seller has minimal export capability

### FCA (Free Carrier)
**Seller's Obligation:** Deliver goods to carrier at named place, export clearance
**Buyer's Responsibility:** Main carriage, import clearance, insurance from carrier acceptance
**Use Case:** Balanced; Common for containerized shipments

### CPT (Carriage Paid To)
**Seller's Obligation:** Deliver to carrier, pay carriage to destination, export clearance
**Buyer's Responsibility:** Import clearance, insurance, unloading, risk transfers at first carrier
**Use Case:** Seller arranges transport but buyer bears risk during transit

### CIP (Carriage and Insurance Paid To)
**Seller's Obligation:** As CPT plus insurance during main carriage
**Buyer's Responsibility:** Import clearance, unloading
**Use Case:** Similar to CPT but seller provides insurance

### DAP (Delivered at Place)
**Seller's Obligation:** Deliver ready for unloading at destination, including carriage
**Buyer's Responsibility:** Unloading, import clearance
**Use Case:** Seller manages logistics, buyer handles import formalities

### DPU (Delivered at Place Unloaded)
**Seller's Obligation:** Deliver and unload at named place
**Buyer's Responsibility:** Import clearance
**Use Case:** Seller has strong logistics including destination handling

### DDP (Delivered Duty Paid)
**Seller's Obligation:** Maximum - All costs and risks to destination including import duty
**Buyer's Responsibility:** Minimum - Receive goods
**Use Case:** Turn-key delivery; Buyer wants no logistics involvement

## FOB (Free On Board) - Sea/Inland Waterway Only
**Seller's Obligation:** Load goods on vessel, export clearance
**Buyer's Responsibility:** Main carriage, insurance, import, risk from vessel loading
**Use Case:** Traditional ocean freight

## CIF (Cost, Insurance, Freight) - Sea/Inland Waterway Only
**Seller's Obligation:** As FOB plus main carriage and insurance to destination port
**Buyer's Responsibility:** Import clearance, onward transport from port
**Use Case:** Seller arranges ocean freight and insurance

## Selection Criteria

### Consider:
- Logistics capabilities of both parties
- Cost optimization
- Risk appetite
- Control preferences
- Customs and compliance expertise
- Insurance arrangements
- Industry practices

### For Aerospace/Space Programs:
- Often FCA or DAP to balance control and cost
- DDP for critical items where seller has expertise
- Avoid EXW for international shipments (export compliance complexity)
- Clear documentation for audit trail

## Documentation Requirements

### Seller Responsibilities (vary by Incoterm):
- Commercial invoice
- Packing list
- Export license (if required)
- Certificate of origin
- Inspection certificates
- Insurance policy (if seller's responsibility)
- Transport documents (depending on Incoterm)

### Buyer Responsibilities:
- Import license (if required)
- Payment for goods
- Import duties and taxes (depending on Incoterm)
- Unloading (depending on Incoterm)

## Risk Transfer Point

Critical to understand when risk transfers from seller to buyer:
- **EXW:** At seller's premises
- **FCA:** When goods handed to first carrier
- **FOB:** When goods on board vessel
- **CPT/CIP:** When goods handed to first carrier (NOT at destination)
- **DAP/DPU/DDP:** At destination (but DPU after unloading)
