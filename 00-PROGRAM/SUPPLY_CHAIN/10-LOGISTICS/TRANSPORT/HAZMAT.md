# Hazardous Materials Transportation

## Overview

Requirements and procedures for transporting hazardous materials (dangerous goods) in compliance with regulations.

## Regulatory Framework

### United States
- **DOT (Department of Transportation):** 49 CFR regulations
- **Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA):** Enforcement
- **EPA:** Environmental regulations
- **OSHA:** Workplace safety

### International
- **IATA (Air):** Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR)
- **IMDG (Ocean):** International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code
- **UN Recommendations:** Globally Harmonized System (GHS)
- **ADR (Europe Road):** Agreement on Dangerous Goods by Road

## Hazard Classes

### UN Classification
1. **Class 1:** Explosives
2. **Class 2:** Gases (compressed, liquefied, refrigerated, dissolved)
3. **Class 3:** Flammable liquids
4. **Class 4:** Flammable solids, spontaneously combustible, dangerous when wet
5. **Class 5:** Oxidizers and organic peroxides
6. **Class 6:** Toxic substances and infectious substances
7. **Class 7:** Radioactive materials
8. **Class 8:** Corrosives
9. **Class 9:** Miscellaneous dangerous goods (e.g., lithium batteries, magnetized materials)

## Common Aerospace Hazmat

### Lithium Batteries
- **UN 3480:** Lithium ion batteries
- **UN 3481:** Lithium ion batteries contained in/packed with equipment
- **UN 3090:** Lithium metal batteries
- **UN 3091:** Lithium metal batteries contained in/packed with equipment

**Requirements:**
- Packaging per Section II (if <100 Wh for Li-ion or <1g lithium content for Li-metal)
- Proper labeling and marking
- Documentation (Shipper's Declaration for DG)
- State of Charge (SoC) limitations (30% for shipment)

### Magnetized Materials
- **UN 2807:** Magnetized material (Class 9)
- Magnetic field >0.00525 gauss at 15 feet

**Requirements:**
- Proper packaging and separation
- "Magnetized Material" label
- IATA/IMDG compliance

### Corrosives
- **Paints, adhesives, cleaning solutions**
- Battery electrolyte
- Etching solutions

**Requirements:**
- Compatible packaging (tested and certified)
- Corrosive label
- Emergency response information

### Compressed Gases
- Nitrogen, helium (for purging, testing)
- Oxygen
- Propellants (ITAR controlled)

**Requirements:**
- DOT-approved cylinders
- Valve protection
- Proper securing and handling
- Shipper's Declaration

## Hazmat Training

### DOT/IATA Requirements
- Initial training required for employees involved in hazmat shipping
- Recurrent training every 2-3 years
- Security awareness training
- Function-specific training

### Training Topics
- Hazmat identification and classification
- Packaging and marking requirements
- Labeling and placarding
- Documentation (Shipper's Declaration)
- Emergency response
- Security

## Packaging Requirements

### UN Performance Packaging
- Tested and certified for hazard class
- Proper specification marking (e.g., UN 4G/Y8/S/18/USA)
- Closure and sealing per requirements
- Compatibility with contents

### Cushioning and Absorbent
- Protect against damage and leakage
- Absorbent material for liquids
- Separation for incompatible materials
- Overpacking if needed

## Marking and Labeling

### Package Marking
- Proper Shipping Name
- UN Number (e.g., UN 3480)
- Consignee and consignor information
- Orientation arrows (if applicable)
- Emergency contact number

### Labels
- Primary hazard label
- Subsidiary hazard labels (if applicable)
- Handling labels ("Cargo Aircraft Only", "Keep Away from Heat", etc.)
- Size and placement per regulations

## Documentation

### Shipper's Declaration of Dangerous Goods
- Required for most hazmat shipments
- Proper Shipping Name, UN number, Class, Packing Group
- Quantity and packaging information
- Shipper and consignee details
- Shipper certification and signature
- Emergency contact information

### Air Waybill / Bill of Lading
- Indicate "Dangerous Goods as per attached Shipper's Declaration"
- Emergency contact number
- Handling information for carrier

## Exceptions and Exemptions

### Limited Quantities (LQ)
- Small quantities per package meeting specific criteria
- Simplified labeling (diamond mark)
- Reduced documentation requirements
- Not available for all materials/classes

### Excepted Quantities (EQ)
- Very small quantities
- Special inner packaging requirements
- Simplified marking
- No hazard labels required

### IATA Special Provisions
- May allow relaxed requirements for specific items
- Check current IATA DGR for applicability

## Carrier Restrictions

### Air Transport
- Some materials prohibited on passenger aircraft ("Cargo Aircraft Only")
- Quantity limitations per package and per aircraft
- NOTOC (Notification to Captain) required

### Ocean Transport
- Proper stowage and segregation
- Compatibility with other cargo
- Container placarding
- Dangerous goods manifest

## Emergency Response

### Emergency Information
- 24-hour emergency contact number (e.g., CHEMTREC)
- Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS/SDS) available
- Emergency response procedures
- Spill and leak response

### Incident Reporting
- Immediate notification of incidents
- DOT reporting requirements (for serious incidents)
- Investigation and corrective actions
- Record keeping

## Best Practices

### Proactive Identification
- Review materials for hazmat classification during sourcing
- Work with suppliers to provide proper documentation
- Maintain hazmat database for parts and materials

### Training and Competency
- Ensure all involved personnel are trained
- Regular refresher training
- Stay current with regulatory changes
- Designate hazmat coordinator

### Carrier Coordination
- Notify carriers of hazmat in advance
- Use carriers with hazmat capabilities and certifications
- Provide proper documentation
- Ensure packaging and labeling compliance before tender

### Continuous Compliance
- Regular audits of hazmat procedures
- Review of shipping records
- Investigation of issues or near-misses
- Updates for regulatory changes
