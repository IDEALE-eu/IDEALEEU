# Packaging and Labeling

## Overview

Requirements for protective packaging, handling, and labeling of materials and products.

## Packaging Requirements

### Protective Packaging
**Objectives:**
- Protect from physical damage (shock, vibration, compression)
- Protect from environmental exposure (moisture, temperature, contamination)
- Facilitate handling and transportation
- Comply with regulations (hazmat, ITAR)
- Cost-effective and sustainable

**Materials:**
- Corrugated containers
- Foam (EPS, PE, PU)
- Anti-static/ESD protective packaging (for electronics)
- Moisture barriers (desiccants, vapor barriers)
- Crating and palletizing for heavy items

### Packaging Standards
- **ASTM D3951:** Commercial packaging
- **MIL-STD-2073:** Military packaging
- **ISTA procedures:** Package testing
- **ISO 21067:** Packaging for transport
- **ECSS-Q-ST-70-71C:** Space hardware packaging (for spacecraft items)

### Special Requirements

**ESD-Sensitive Items:**
- Anti-static bags or containers
- ESD warning labels
- Handling instructions
- Grounding requirements

**ITAR-Controlled Items:**
- Sealed tamper-evident packaging
- ITAR markings visible
- Access controls and custody
- Secure transportation

**Hazardous Materials:**
- UN/DOT compliant packaging
- Proper classification and labeling
- Handling and emergency instructions
- Regulatory documentation

## Labeling Requirements

### Standard Label Content
1. **Part Identification:**
   - Part number
   - Revision level
   - Description
   - Serial number (if serialized)

2. **Quantity Information:**
   - Quantity in package
   - Unit of measure

3. **Supplier Information:**
   - Supplier name and code
   - Manufacturing date or lot/batch number
   - Country of origin

4. **Purchase Order Reference:**
   - PO number
   - Line item
   - Release number (if applicable)

5. **Handling Instructions:**
   - "This Side Up"
   - "Fragile"
   - "ESD Sensitive"
   - Weight and center of gravity
   - Temperature limits

6. **Compliance Markings:**
   - "ITAR Controlled"
   - Hazmat symbols and UN numbers
   - Conflict minerals declaration (if applicable)
   - REACH/RoHS compliance

7. **Traceability:**
   - Lot or batch number
   - Serial numbers (for serialized items)
   - Certificate of Conformance reference

8. **Barcodes/QR Codes:**
   - Part number barcode
   - Serial number barcode (if applicable)
   - GS1-128 or similar format

### Label Placement
- Visible on at least two sides of package
- Durable adhesive suitable for conditions
- Legible and scannable
- Not obscuring other critical markings

### Aerospace/Space Specific

**AS9100/ECSS Requirements:**
- Certificate of Conformance included or referenced
- Traceability to manufacturing lot/batch
- Test data references
- Special storage conditions
- Shelf life or expiration dates

## Returnable Packaging

### Use Cases
- High-volume repetitive shipments
- Expensive or specialized containers
- Environmental sustainability goals
- Cost savings over single-use

### Management
- Ownership clearly defined
- Asset tracking and return procedures
- Cleaning and maintenance responsibilities
- Loss or damage policies
- Cost allocation

## Environmental Considerations

### Sustainability
- Minimize packaging material
- Use recycled and recyclable materials
- Avoid non-recyclable foams where possible
- Lightweight packaging to reduce transport emissions
- Reusable packaging programs

### Regulatory Compliance
- Packaging waste directives (EU)
- Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)
- State and local regulations
- Customer requirements

## Documentation

### Packing List
- Detailed contents of shipment
- Part numbers, descriptions, quantities
- Gross and net weights
- Number of packages
- Dimensions

### Certificate of Conformance (CoC)
- Confirmation of compliance to specifications
- Test results and inspection data
- Certifications and approvals
- Traceability information

### Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS/SDS)
- For hazardous materials
- Handling and emergency procedures
- Regulatory compliance information
