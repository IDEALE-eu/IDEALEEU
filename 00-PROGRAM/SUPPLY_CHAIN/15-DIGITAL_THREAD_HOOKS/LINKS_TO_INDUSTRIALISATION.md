## Overview

Integration between supply chain and industrialisation/manufacturing engineering.

## Key Integration Points

### Design for Manufacturing (DFM)
**Supplier Input:**
- Manufacturability review during design
- Process capability feedback
- Cost optimization suggestions
- Alternative materials or processes

**Early Supplier Involvement (ESI):**
- Concurrent engineering with key suppliers
- Design reviews with manufacturing experts
- Prototyping and validation
- Production readiness assessment

### Tooling and Equipment
**From INDUSTRIALISATION:**
- Tooling specifications and designs
- Equipment requirements
- Capacity needs
- Investment justification

**From SUPPLY_CHAIN:**
- Tooling quotes and lead times
- Supplier capability assessment
- Tooling ownership agreements
- Maintenance and lifecycle cost

### Production Part Approval Process (PPAP)
**Coordination:**
- PPAP requirements definition
- Sample production runs
- Dimensional and functional testing
- Documentation review and approval
- Supplier readiness verification

**Links:**
- PPAP checklists and procedures
- First Article Inspection (FAI) requirements
- Quality documentation
- Approval status tracking

### Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL)
**Assessment:**
- Supplier manufacturing capability
- Production process maturity
- Quality system readiness
- Supply chain stability
- Risk mitigation

**Transition:**
- Low-rate initial production (LRIP)
- Ramp-up planning
- Full-rate production (FRP) qualification
- Ongoing support and improvement

### Rate Readiness
**Capacity Planning:**
- Production volume forecasts
- Supplier capacity validation
- Bottleneck identification and resolution
- Flex capacity arrangements
- Multi-shift or multi-site planning

**Supply Chain Synchronization:**
- Material availability
- Lead time alignment
- Buffer inventory
- Just-in-time (JIT) delivery
- Pull systems and kanban
