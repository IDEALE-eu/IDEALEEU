## Space Environment Challenges

### Radiation
- Total Ionizing Dose (TID)
- Single Event Effects (SEE)
  - Single Event Upset (SEU)
  - Single Event Latchup (SEL)
  - Single Event Functional Interrupt (SEFI)
- Displacement damage

### Thermal
- Extreme temperature ranges
- Thermal cycling
- Vacuum operation

### Mechanical
- Vibration and shock during launch
- Acoustic loading
- Zero-gravity operation

### Reliability
- No repair or replacement possible
- Long mission life (5-15+ years)
- High reliability required (99.9%+)

## Procurement Flow

### Part Selection
1. AML review and selection
2. Radiation data verification
3. Availability and lead time check
4. Cost and budget
5. Procurement authorization

### Ordering
1. Purchase order with space-grade specifications
2. Lot date code specification (if required)
3. COC requirements detailed
4. Screening and testing requirements
5. Traceability documentation

### Receiving and Screening
1. Incoming inspection (external visual)
2. COC verification
3. Lot screening per plan (electrical, environmental)
4. Destructive physical analysis (DPA) sample
5. Acceptance or rejection
6. Lot quarantine or release

### Storage and Handling
1. ESD protected storage
2. Environmental controls (temperature, humidity)
3. Limited shelf life monitoring
4. Serialized tracking
5. Controlled access

## Quality Requirements

### Manufacturer Qualification
- ESCC qualified parts (preferred)
- NASA EEE-INST-002 compliance
- MIL-PRF parts with full traceability
- Manufacturer quality system (AS9100 or equivalent)
- Approved Manufacturer List (AML)

### Lot Acceptance
- Certificate of Conformance (COC)
- Test data package
- Traceability documentation
- Lot date code acceptance
- Visual inspection (per MIL-STD-883 or equivalent)

### Screening
- Environmental stress screening (ESS)
- Burn-in per MIL-STD-883 Method 1015
- Temperature cycling
- Electrical testing
- Radiographic inspection (X-ray)
- Destructive physical analysis (DPA) on samples

## Lifecycle Management

### Obsolescence
- Proactive monitoring (industry databases)
- Lifetime buys when EOL announced
- Alternative part qualification
- Design refresh planning
- Strategic inventory

### Counterfeit Prevention
- Authorized sources only
- Full traceability chain
- Inspection and testing
- Suspect counterfeit reporting
- GIDEP (Government-Industry Data Exchange Program) alerts

## Documentation

### Part Data Package
- Manufacturer datasheet
- Radiation test reports (TID, SEE)
- Qualification test reports
- COC for each lot
- Screening and inspection results
- Traceability documents
- Storage and handling requirements

### Records Retention
- Lifetime of program
- Flight hardware traceability
- Audit trail for quality and compliance
- Electronic and physical archives
