# First Article Inspection (FAI)

## Overview

FAI verifies that production parts conform to engineering requirements before full production.

## When FAI is Required

- New part or product
- Engineering change affecting form, fit, or function
- New or modified tooling
- New or modified process
- Change in supplier or manufacturing location
- After production break >2 years
- Natural or man-made event affecting process

## FAI Process

### Planning
- Review drawings and specifications
- Identify characteristics to be verified
- Prepare inspection plan
- Identify inspection methods and equipment

### Inspection
- Complete dimensional inspection per drawing
- Material verification
- Performance testing
- Appearance inspection
- Special characteristics verification

### Documentation
- FAI report (AS9102 format for aerospace)
- Dimensional results
- Material certifications
- Test results
- Photos of critical features
- Inspection equipment list

### Review and Approval
- Quality engineer review
- Engineering review if required
- Customer approval (if contractually required)
- Documentation filed

## AS9102 FAI Requirements

### Form 1: Part Number Accountability
- Part information
- Engineering level
- Organization accountability

### Form 2: Product Accountability
- Detailed characteristic verification
- Actual measurements
- Inspection methods
- Results (pass/fail)

### Form 3: Process/Material/Performance
- Material verification
- Performance testing
- Special process verification
- Process parameters

## Partial FAI

When only specific characteristics affected by change:
- Document change authorization
- Verify only affected characteristics
- Reference original FAI for unchanged features
- Justify partial FAI approach

## FAI Retention

- Retain FAI records for life of program or per contract
- Update with engineering changes
- Available for customer review
- Part of quality documentation package
