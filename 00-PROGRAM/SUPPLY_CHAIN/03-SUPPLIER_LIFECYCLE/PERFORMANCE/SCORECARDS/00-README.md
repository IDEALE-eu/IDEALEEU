## Metrics Definitions

### Quality Metrics

**PPM (Parts Per Million):**
- Formula: (Rejected qty / Total qty received) × 1,000,000
- Target: <500 PPM for standard, <100 for critical
- Data source: Receiving inspection, in-process inspection

**SCAR Closure Rate:**
- Formula: SCARs closed on time / Total SCARs × 100%
- Target: >90% within agreed timeframe
- Data source: SCAR tracking system

**Quality Incidents:**
- Count of significant quality events
- Severity rating (Critical, Major, Minor)
- Target: Zero critical, minimize major

### Delivery Metrics

**OTD (On-Time Delivery):**
- Formula: On-time deliveries / Total deliveries × 100%
- On-time defined: Within agreed window (e.g., ±2 days)
- Target: >95%
- Data source: Receiving and ERP system

**OTIF (On-Time In-Full):**
- Formula: Deliveries on-time AND complete / Total deliveries × 100%
- Complete: 100% of ordered quantity
- Target: >90%
- Data source: Receiving and ERP system

### Cost Metrics

**Price Competitiveness:**
- Comparison to market benchmarks
- Bid competitiveness
- Cost reduction vs. targets
- Target: Within 5% of market, annual cost reduction

**Invoice Accuracy:**
- Formula: Accurate invoices / Total invoices × 100%

- Data source: Accounts payable

### Service Metrics

**Responsiveness:**
- Response time to inquiries (<24 hours target)
- Issue resolution time
- Communication quality rating
- Measured via survey and tracking

**Innovation:**
- Number of value engineering proposals
- Cost savings from innovations
- Technology improvements suggested
- Collaborative development projects
