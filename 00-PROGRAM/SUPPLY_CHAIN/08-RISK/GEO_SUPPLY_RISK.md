# Geographic and Geopolitical Supply Risks

## Overview

Assessment and management of risks related to supplier geographic location and geopolitical factors.

## Geographic Risk Factors

### Natural Disaster Risk
**Seismic Activity:**
- Earthquake zones (Japan, California, Chile, Turkey)
- Tsunami risk areas
- Volcanic activity regions

**Weather Events:**
- Hurricane/typhoon prone areas
- Flood zones
- Tornado corridors
- Severe winter weather regions

**Other Natural Hazards:**
- Wildfire risk areas
- Drought prone regions
- Extreme heat zones

### Infrastructure Risks
- Transportation chokepoints (Suez Canal, Panama Canal, Straits)
- Port congestion and capacity
- Rail and road infrastructure
- Power grid reliability
- Water supply stability

### Regional Concentration
- Multiple suppliers in same region
- Shared infrastructure dependencies
- Common supply chain nodes
- Geographic clustering effects

## Geopolitical Risk Factors

### Political Stability
- Government stability index
- Civil unrest history
- Corruption perceptions
- Rule of law
- Property rights protection

### Trade Policy
- Tariffs and trade barriers
- Export restrictions
- Import quotas and licenses
- Trade agreement status
- Sanctions and embargoes

### Strategic Resources
- Critical materials and rare earths
- Strategic technology
- Export controls and restrictions
- National security considerations
- Foreign investment restrictions

### Regional Tensions
- Border disputes
- Military conflicts
- Diplomatic relations
- Alliance structures
- Historical grievances

## Risk Assessment

### Country Risk Scoring
**Factors Evaluated:**
- Political stability (weight: 30%)
- Economic stability (weight: 20%)
- Infrastructure quality (weight: 15%)
- Natural disaster risk (weight: 15%)
- Legal/regulatory environment (weight: 10%)
- Corruption level (weight: 10%)

**Risk Levels:**
- **Low Risk:** Stable developed countries
- **Medium Risk:** Developing economies, moderate stability
- **High Risk:** Political instability, poor infrastructure
- **Critical Risk:** Active conflict, severe instability

### Supplier Geographic Analysis
- Map all suppliers by location
- Identify geographic concentrations
- Assess regional risk levels
- Evaluate alternatives
- Prioritize diversification

## Mitigation Strategies

### Geographic Diversification
- Multi-region sourcing
- Avoid single-country dependencies for critical items
- Balance low-cost vs. low-risk locations
- Near-shore and onshore options for critical items

### Strategic Inventory
- Buffer stock for high-risk locations
- Safety stock calculations include geographic risk
- Strategic material reserves
- Distribution center placement

### Flexible Supply Network
- Pre-qualified alternative suppliers
- Flexible manufacturing arrangements
- Technology transfer capabilities
- Rapid re-sourcing procedures

### Monitoring and Intelligence
- Real-time risk monitoring services
- News and alert systems
- Government advisories
- Industry intelligence sharing
- Early warning indicators

## Response Planning

### Warning Levels
**Level 1 - Watch:**
- Increased monitoring
- Communication check with supplier
- Inventory assessment
- No immediate action needed

**Level 2 - Alert:**
- Enhanced monitoring
- Supplier status updates
- Inventory build if feasible
- Alternative supplier communication
- Management notification

**Level 3 - Activation:**
- Business continuity team activation
- Implementation of contingency plans
- Alternative sourcing activation
- Customer communication
- Executive involvement

**Level 4 - Recovery:**
- Return to normal operations
- Lessons learned
- Plan updates
- Post-event review

## Specific Regional Considerations

### Asia-Pacific
- Seismic activity (Japan, Taiwan, Philippines)
- Typhoon season preparedness
- South China Sea tensions
- China-Taiwan-US dynamics
- Supply chain concentration

### Europe
- Political stability generally high
- Brexit impacts
- EU regulations
- Energy supply dependencies (Russia)
- Migration and social issues

### Americas
- Hurricane season (Caribbean, Gulf Coast)
- Political instability (some Latin American countries)
- USMCA trade bloc benefits
- Nearshoring trends

### Middle East / Africa
- Political instability hotspots
- Infrastructure challenges
- Suez Canal dependency
- Resource-rich but risky
- Emerging opportunities

## Continuous Monitoring

### Data Sources
- World Bank Governance Indicators
- Political risk indices
- Natural disaster databases
- Trade policy monitoring
- News and intelligence services
- Industry associations

### Review Cadence
- Annual comprehensive review
- Quarterly risk assessment updates
- Real-time monitoring for alerts
- Post-event reviews
- Supplier risk rating updates

### Reporting
- Geographic risk dashboard
- Concentration analysis
- Mitigation status
- Incidents and impacts
- Executive summary
