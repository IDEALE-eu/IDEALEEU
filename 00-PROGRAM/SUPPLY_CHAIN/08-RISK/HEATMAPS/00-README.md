## Risk Heatmap Matrix

### Probability Scale
- **Low (1):** Unlikely to occur (<10% chance)
- **Medium (2):** Possible (10-50% chance)
- **High (3):** Likely (>50% chance)

### Impact Scale
- **Low (1):** Minimal business impact
- **Medium (2):** Moderate impact, manageable
- **High (3):** Significant impact to operations
- **Critical (4):** Severe impact, program risk

### Risk Score
Risk Score = Probability Ã— Impact

### Priority Levels
- **Critical (9-12):** Immediate action required
- **High (6-8):** Priority mitigation needed
- **Medium (3-5):** Monitor and plan mitigation
- **Low (1-2):** Accept or monitor
