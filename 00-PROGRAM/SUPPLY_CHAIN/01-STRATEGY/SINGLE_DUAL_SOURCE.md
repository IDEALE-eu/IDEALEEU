# Single vs. Dual Source Strategy

## Overview

Guidelines for determining single source vs. dual/multiple source strategies for components and materials.

## Single Source Strategy

### When Appropriate
- Proprietary technology or design
- Low volume with high setup costs
- Strong strategic partnership
- Limited qualified supplier base
- Standardized commodity with low risk

### Advantages
- Volume leverage for better pricing
- Simplified quality management
- Reduced administrative overhead
- Stronger supplier relationship
- Streamlined logistics

### Risks
- Supply disruption vulnerability
- Price leverage by supplier
- Capacity constraints
- Quality issues impact
- Innovation dependency

### Risk Mitigation
- Contractual protections
- Strategic inventory buffer
- Supplier financial monitoring
- Business continuity planning
- Escrow arrangements for critical tooling

## Dual/Multiple Source Strategy

### When Required
- Critical path components
- High volume requirements
- Volatile commodity markets
- New technology development
- Geopolitical risk considerations
- Export control considerations (ITAR)

### Advantages
- Supply security and redundancy
- Competitive pressure on pricing
- Capacity flexibility
- Technology innovation from multiple sources
- Geographic risk diversification

### Challenges
- Increased qualification costs
- Complex quality management
- Volume split decisions
- Higher administrative burden
- Potential for spec drift between sources

### Implementation Guidelines
- Qualification requirements for all sources
- Clear allocation rules (primary/secondary)
- Interchangeability verification
- Performance monitoring for all sources
- Regular re-sourcing events

## Decision Matrix

### Criticality Assessment
- **Critical:** Impact on flight safety, mission success, or production line
- **Important:** Significant impact but workarounds available
- **Standard:** Minimal impact, multiple alternatives exist

### Supply Risk Assessment
- **High:** Single supplier, long lead times, volatile market
- **Medium:** Limited suppliers, moderate lead times
- **Low:** Multiple suppliers, short lead times, stable market

### Decision Framework
- High Criticality + High Risk = **Dual source required**
- High Criticality + Medium Risk = **Dual source preferred**
- High Criticality + Low Risk = **Single source with monitoring**
- Medium Criticality + High Risk = **Dual source preferred**
- Low Criticality + Any Risk = **Single source acceptable**

## Monitoring and Review

### Regular Reviews
- Annual strategy review for all categories
- Trigger-based reviews for:
  - Supplier financial issues
  - Quality problems
  - Capacity constraints
  - Market disruptions
  - Technology changes

### Performance Metrics
- Supply continuity (on-time delivery)
- Cost competitiveness
- Quality performance
- Flexibility and responsiveness
- Innovation contribution
