# Price Analysis

## Overview

Price analysis evaluates the reasonableness of proposed prices without detailed cost analysis.

## Price Analysis Methods

### 1. Competitive Quotes Comparison
**Approach:**
- Obtain quotes from multiple qualified suppliers (minimum 3)
- Compare pricing for same requirements
- Evaluate total cost of ownership, not just unit price

**Advantages:**
- Market-driven pricing
- Competitive pressure
- Objective comparison

**Considerations:**
- Ensure apples-to-apples comparison (same specs, quantities, terms)
- Quality and reliability differences among suppliers
- Total cost beyond price (quality, delivery, support)

### 2. Historical Pricing
**Approach:**
- Compare current quote to previous pricing for same or similar item
- Adjust for volume, inflation, material cost changes
- Trend analysis over time

**Advantages:**
- Objective baseline
- Identify unusual increases
- Negotiate based on history

**Considerations:**
- Market conditions change
- Material and labor cost inflation
- Volume differences impact unit price
- Scope or specification changes

### 3. Market Research and Benchmarking
**Approach:**
- Research market pricing through industry sources
- Benchmark against similar items or programs
- Use published price indices

**Sources:**
- Industry publications and price surveys
- Trade associations
- Government pricing databases
- Third-party market research

**Advantages:**
- Independent market validation
- Industry norms and trends
- Negotiation leverage

**Considerations:**
- May not be exact match to requirements
- Data availability and currency
- Confidentiality of benchmarks

### 4. Published Price Lists
**Approach:**
- Use catalog or published pricing
- Apply discounts for volume or relationship

**Advantages:**
- Transparent and readily available
- Easy to compare and validate

**Applicability:**
- Catalog or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items
- Limited for custom or engineered products

### 5. Parametric Estimating
**Approach:**
- Estimate based on relationships between price and physical/performance characteristics
- Example: $/kg for materials, $/Watt for electronics
- Statistical models from historical data

**Advantages:**
- Quick estimates for early planning
- Useful when detailed data unavailable
- Identify outliers

**Considerations:**
- Accuracy depends on model validity
- Complexity and customization not fully captured
- Best for similar items within experience base

### 6. Independent Cost Estimates
**Approach:**
- Internal or third-party should-cost estimate
- Bottom-up cost build-up

**Advantages:**
- Detailed understanding of cost drivers
- Strong negotiation position
- Identify improvement opportunities

**Considerations:**
- Time and resource intensive
- Requires access to design and process information
- See SHOULD_COST_MODELS section

## Price Reasonableness Assessment

### Red Flags
- Significant price increase without justification
- Much higher or lower than competition
- Resistance to provide cost breakdown
- Unusual terms or conditions
- Large cost discrepancies among bidders

### Validation Steps
1. Compare to multiple sources (competitive quotes, historical, benchmarks)
2. Challenge outliers with supplier
3. Request cost breakdown or justification for high prices
4. Perform should-cost analysis for significant or strategic buys
5. Negotiate based on data and analysis
6. Document price reasonableness determination

## Price vs. Cost Trade-offs

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
**Beyond Unit Price:**
- Quality costs (inspection, rework, scrap, warranty)
- Delivery performance (expedite costs, production disruption)
- Administrative costs (order processing, invoicing, problem resolution)
- Inventory carrying costs (safety stock, obsolescence)
- Relationship and development costs

**TCO Evaluation:**
- Low price may not be lowest total cost
- Balance price with quality, delivery, service
- Consider long-term strategic value

### Price vs. Value
- Supplier innovation and technical support
- Flexibility and responsiveness
- Financial stability and business continuity
- Ethical and sustainable practices

## Negotiation Support

### Preparation
- Gather price analysis data (comparisons, benchmarks, history)
- Understand cost drivers and supplier's position
- Define target price and walk-away point
- Identify trade-offs and alternatives

### Negotiation Tactics
- Lead with data (show your analysis)
- Focus on mutual benefit (cost reduction, volume commitment)
- Unbundle and negotiate components separately if beneficial
- Explore creative solutions (material substitution, process changes, longer terms)
- Be willing to walk away if price unreasonable

### Documentation
- Document negotiation and price agreement
- Justification for price reasonableness
- Any commitments or conditions
- Approval per delegation of authority

## Continuous Monitoring

### Price Trends
- Track prices over time
- Identify cost drivers (material indices, labor inflation)
- Anticipate price changes
- Proactive discussions with suppliers

### Cost Reduction Initiatives
- Ongoing value engineering
- Process improvements
- Volume leverage
- Strategic partnerships
- Market competition
