**Cost Breakdown Request Letter:**

```
[Date]

[Supplier Name and Address]

Subject: Request for Cost Breakdown - [Part Number/Description]

Dear [Supplier Contact],

We are conducting a cost analysis for [part number/description] and request
a detailed cost breakdown to support pricing discussions.

Please provide the following information:

1. Direct Material costs (by material type and quantity)
2. Purchased components costs (itemized)
3. Direct labor costs (by operation with hours and rates)
4. Manufacturing overhead rate and amount
5. General and administrative (G&A) rate and amount
6. Profit margin
7. NRE costs and amortization (if applicable)
8. Assumptions (production volume, lead time, material prices)

Please structure the cost breakdown using our attached template for consistency.

This information will be treated as confidential and used solely for cost
analysis and negotiation purposes.

We request this information by [date]. Please contact me if you have questions
or concerns.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
[Name, Title]

## Analyzing Cost Breakdowns

### Validation Steps

1. **Completeness Check:**
   - All cost elements present
   - Totals add up correctly
   - Assumptions documented

2. **Reasonableness Check:**
   - Material costs aligned with market prices
   - Labor hours realistic for operations
   - Overhead rates within industry norms (100-200% typical)
   - G&A rates reasonable (10-25% typical)
   - Profit margins appropriate (10-20% production, 15-30% development)

3. **Benchmarking:**
   - Compare to should-cost model (if available)
   - Compare to similar items or programs
   - Compare to competitive quotes
   - Industry benchmarks

4. **Cost Driver Analysis:**
   - Identify major cost contributors
   - Assess opportunities for reduction
   - Focus on high-impact items

### Common Issues

- Excessive overhead or G&A rates
- Inflated labor hours or rates
- Material costs above market
- Double-counting (e.g., scrap in both material and overhead)
- Profit on top of profit (profit in overhead, then profit on total)
- Lack of transparency or detail

### Negotiation Based on Cost Breakdown

**Focus Areas:**
- Challenge specific cost elements with data
- Propose cost reduction ideas (material substitution, process changes)
- Negotiate overhead and profit rates
- Volume leverage for material and labor costs
- Amortization period for NRE and tooling
- Long-term commitments for better rates

## Confidentiality and Use

### Supplier Confidentiality
- Cost breakdowns contain proprietary information
- Treat as confidential per NDA
- Limit distribution to need-to-know
- Do not share with competitors
- Use only for intended purpose

### Best Practices
- Build trust with suppliers
- Explain the purpose and benefit (cost reduction collaboration)
- Respect supplier's need for fair profit
- Be transparent about analysis and concerns
- Collaborative approach yields better results than adversarial

## Cost Breakdown Database

### Maintain Repository
- Historical cost breakdowns
- Indexed by commodity or part type
- Benchmarking and reference
- Cost estimating for new items
- Lessons learned and trends

### Analysis and Insights
- Cost trends over time
- Material, labor, overhead benchmarks
- Supplier pricing strategies
- Best practices and opportunities
