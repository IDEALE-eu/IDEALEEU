## Overview

Integration between supply chain and industrialization/manufacturing engineering.

## Key Integration Points

### Design for Manufacturing (DFM)
- Early supplier involvement (ESI)
- Manufacturability review
- Cost optimization
- See: **../../INDUSTRIALISATION/DFM_DFA.md**

### Tooling and Equipment
- Tooling requirements and design
- Supplier capability assessment
- Tooling ownership and management
- See: **../../INDUSTRIALISATION/TOOLING.md** and **12-TOOLING_PROPERTY/**

### PPAP and FAI
- Production Part Approval Process
- First Article Inspection
- Qualification and approval
- See: **../../INDUSTRIALISATION/PPAP_FAI.md** and **06-SUPPLIER_QUALITY/PPAP/**

### Production Readiness
- Supplier manufacturing readiness
- Capacity validation
- Ramp-up planning
- See: **../../INDUSTRIALISATION/RATE_READINESS.md**

### Make vs. Buy
- Strategic sourcing decisions
- Capability comparison
- Cost-benefit analysis
- See: **01-STRATEGY/MAKE_BUY.md**

## Manufacturing Integration

### Process Specifications
- Manufacturing process requirements
- Special processes (welding, heat treat, coating, etc.)
- Supplier process qualification
- See: **../../INDUSTRIALISATION/PROCESSES/**

### Manufacturing Execution
- Production schedules
- Material availability
- Quality inspection
- Traceability
- See: **../../INDUSTRIALISATION/MES/**
