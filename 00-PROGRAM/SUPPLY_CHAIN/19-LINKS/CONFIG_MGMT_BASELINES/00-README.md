# Links to Configuration Management Baselines

## Overview

Integration between supply chain and configuration management for baseline control.

## Key Integration Points

### Part Numbering
- Company part numbering system
- Supplier part number cross-reference
- AML (Approved Manufacturer List) with manufacturer PNs
- See: **../../CONFIG_MGMT/PART_NUMBERING.md**

### Bill of Materials (BOM)
- EBOM (Engineering BOM) from design
- MBOM (Manufacturing BOM) with supplier info
- Costed BOM with supply chain data
- See: **../../CONFIG_MGMT/BOM_MANAGEMENT.md**

### Engineering Change Orders (ECO)
- ECO impact assessment on supply chain
- Supplier notification and quotes
- Lead time impact
- Phase-in/phase-out planning
- See: **../../CONFIG_MGMT/ECO_PROCESS.md**

### Configuration Baselines
- Approved Vendor List (AVL) as part of baseline
- Tooling configuration
- Process specifications
- See: **../../CONFIG_MGMT/BASELINES.md**

## Traceability

### Serial Number Traceability
- Serialized parts from suppliers
- As-built configuration
- Lot/batch traceability
- See: **../../CONFIG_MGMT/TRACEABILITY.md**

### Document Management
- Controlled distribution of drawings and specs to suppliers
- Revision control
- Access rights and ITAR restrictions
- See: **../../CONFIG_MGMT/DOCUMENT_CONTROL.md**
