# TWIN_VALIDATION

Digital twin validation methodology, correlation reports, and validation scripts.

## Purpose

This directory contains the validation methodology for digital twins, including correlation reports comparing model predictions with test and operational data, and automated validation scripts.

## Contents

- **README.md** - This file
- **CORRELATION_REPORTS/** - Model vs. test/fleet data correlation analysis
- **VALIDATION_SCRIPTS/** - Automated validation scripts run during CI/CD

## Validation Methodology

### Validation Hierarchy
1. **Model Verification**: Syntax, consistency, convergence
2. **Model Validation**: Correlation with physical data
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Confidence assessment
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing validation metrics

### Correlation Metrics
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Coefficient of Determination (R²)
- Residual analysis
- Target: R² ≥ 0.85 for critical parameters

### Validation Data Sources
- Ground test data (component, subsystem, system)
- Flight test data (aircraft)
- On-orbit telemetry (spacecraft)
- Manufacturing data
- Maintenance inspection data

## Correlation Reports

Location: `CORRELATION_REPORTS/`

Report structure:
- `REPORT_<SUBSYSTEM>_<DATE>.md` - Correlation analysis report
- `DATA_<SUBSYSTEM>_<DATE>.csv` - Test/operational data
- `PREDICTIONS_<SUBSYSTEM>_<DATE>.csv` - Model predictions
- `PLOTS_<SUBSYSTEM>_<DATE>/` - Correlation plots and charts

Report frequency:
- Design twins: At each stage gate
- Operational twins: Quarterly
- Fleet twins: Annually

## Validation Scripts

Location: `VALIDATION_SCRIPTS/`

Scripts:
- `validate_physics_model.py` - Validate physics-based models
- `validate_ml_model.py` - Validate data-driven models
- `correlation_analysis.py` - Compute correlation metrics
- `generate_validation_report.py` - Auto-generate validation reports
- `interop_test.py` - End-to-end twin integrity checks

Execution:
- Automated via CI/CD pipeline (08-AUTOMATION/CI_CD_PIPELINES/)
- On-demand for specific validation needs
- Scheduled (nightly) for operational twins
