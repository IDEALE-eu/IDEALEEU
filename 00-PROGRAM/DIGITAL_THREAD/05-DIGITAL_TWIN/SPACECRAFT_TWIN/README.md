# SPACECRAFT_TWIN

Spacecraft digital twin models and instances.

## Purpose

This directory contains the digital twin models specific to the spacecraft program, including physics-based models for orbital mechanics, thermal-vacuum, GNC, and per-unit twin instances.

## Contents

- **README.md** - This file
- **PHYSICS_MODELS/** - Orbital, thermal-vacuum, radiation models
- **BEHAVIORAL_MODELS/** - GNC, fault management, autonomy
- **DATA_DRIVEN_MODELS/** - ML models for anomaly detection and prediction
- **TWIN_INSTANCE/** - Per-unit twin instances (e.g., SC-001, SC-002)
- **TWIN_API_SPEC.yaml** - Standardized API interface for mission operations

## Model Organization

### Physics Models
- Orbital mechanics (propagation, maneuvers)
- Thermal-vacuum analysis
- Radiation environment and effects
- Structural dynamics
- Propulsion (chemical, electric)

### Behavioral Models
- GNC (Guidance, Navigation, Control)
- Fault management and recovery
- Power management
- Communication protocols
- Autonomy and onboard decision-making

### Data-Driven Models
- Anomaly detection (telemetry patterns)
- Consumables prediction (propellant, battery)
- Degradation modeling (solar array, batteries)
- Mission planning optimization

## Per-Unit Instances

Each spacecraft has a dedicated twin instance:
- SC-001: First spacecraft (demo mission)
- SC-002: Second spacecraft (operational)
- ...

Each instance includes:
- As-built configuration (verified pre-launch)
- Mission profile (orbit, operations plan)
- On-orbit telemetry and trends
- Anomalies and resolutions
- Consumables tracking
