# DIGITAL_THREAD

The Digital Thread represents the comprehensive framework for managing the entire lifecycle of data, models, and digital artifacts across both aircraft and spacecraft programs. It ensures seamless integration, traceability, and continuity from concept through operations and sustainment.

## Purpose

The Digital Thread enables:
- End-to-end traceability from requirements through operations
- Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) integration
- Digital twin implementation and validation
- Cross-domain data integration (PLM, MES, ERP, QMS)
- Automated validation and certification evidence generation
- Fleet feedback integration into design and operations

## ISO 23247 Alignment

This Digital Thread implementation aligns with ISO 23247 (Automation systems and integration â€” Digital twin framework for manufacturing) adapted for aerospace applications, covering:
- Digital twin architecture and integration
- Data interchange and interoperability
- Security and access control
- Quality assurance and validation

## Key Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each artifact has one authoritative source with controlled distribution
2. **Traceability**: Bi-directional links between requirements, models, tests, and operational data
3. **Automation**: Automated validation, evidence generation, and synchronization
4. **Standards-Based**: Adherence to aerospace and digital thread standards
5. **Security**: Role-based access control with ITAR/EAR compliance
6. **Continuous Validation**: Ongoing verification of model-to-reality correlation

## Integration Points
