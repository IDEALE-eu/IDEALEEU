# 03-ARCHITECTURE

Digital Thread reference architecture and integration points.

## Purpose

This directory defines the technical architecture for the Digital Thread, including the layered reference architecture, data flow diagrams, and stage-gate integration criteria.

## Contents

- **00-README.md** - This file
- **DT_REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.pdf** - Layered digital thread architecture diagram (Data–Model–Service–Application layers)
- **DATA_FLOW_DIAGRAMS/** - C4 or UML diagrams showing data flows for Aircraft, Spacecraft, and Fleet
- **INTEGRATION_POINTS.md** - Stage-gate digital thread readiness criteria (PDR/CDR/TRR/PRR/etc.)

## Architecture Layers

### Layer 1: Data Layer
- Master data management (MDM)
- Time-series data (sensor, telemetry)
- Document management (PLM/PDM)
- Configuration database
- Audit and traceability logs

### Layer 2: Model Layer
- CAD/CAE models (geometry, FEM, CFD)
- MBSE models (SysML architecture)
- Digital twin models (physics-based, behavioral, data-driven)
- Requirements and specifications
- Interface definitions

### Layer 3: Service Layer
- Model validation services
- Simulation execution engines
- Data analytics and ML pipelines
- Integration middleware (OSLC, STEP adapters)
- Certification evidence generators

### Layer 4: Application Layer
- Engineering workbenches (CAD, MBSE tools)
- Manufacturing execution systems (MES)
- Fleet monitoring dashboards
- Decision support applications
- Collaboration and visualization tools

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Security and access control
- Data quality and governance
- Interoperability and standards
- Performance and scalability

## Architecture Principles

1. **Layered Independence**: Each layer can evolve independently with stable interfaces
2. **Standards-Based Integration**: Use open standards (OSLC, STEP, APIs) for all integrations
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Each artifact has one authoritative location
4. **Real-Time Capable**: Architecture supports both batch and streaming data
5. **Secure by Design**: Security controls embedded at every layer

## Data Flow Patterns

### Design Phase
Requirements → MBSE → CAD/CAE → Analysis Results → Design Validation

### Manufacturing Phase
EBOM → MBOM → Work Instructions → As-Built Data → Quality Records

### Operations Phase
Fleet Telemetry → Digital Twin → Analytics → Insights → Design Feedback
