# Integration Points and Stage-Gate Readiness Criteria

## Overview

This document defines the Digital Thread readiness criteria at each program stage gate. The digital thread must demonstrate progressive maturity and capability as the program advances from concept through operations.

## Stage Gate Framework

The program follows a standard aerospace development lifecycle with defined stage gates:

- **SRR** - System Requirements Review
- **MCR** - Mission Concept Review
- **PDR** - Preliminary Design Review
- **CDR** - Critical Design Review
- **TRR** - Test Readiness Review
- **PRR** - Production Readiness Review
- **ORR/EIS** - Operational Readiness Review / Entry Into Service (Aircraft)
- **FRR** - Flight Readiness Review (Spacecraft)

At each gate, the digital thread must satisfy specific criteria to demonstrate capability to support the next phase.

### B. Digital Thread Maturity Assessment

**Maturity Scale** (aligned with 01-STRATEGY/STRATEGY.md):
- Level 1: Initial (ad-hoc, manual)
- Level 2: Managed (documented, basic traceability)

- Level 5: Optimizing (continuous improvement, autonomous)

**Target Maturity by Gate**:
- SRR: Level 1 → 2
- MCR: Level 2
- PDR: Level 2 → 3
- CDR: Level 3

### C. Lessons Learned Template

After each stage gate, capture:
- What went well (digital thread perspective)
- What could be improved
- Specific criteria that were challenging
- Recommendations for future programs
- Tools/processes that should be refined

### D. Waiver Process

If a readiness criterion cannot be met:
1. Document the gap and rationale
2. Risk assessment (technical, schedule, cost impact)
3. Mitigation plan (how gap will be closed post-gate)
4. Approval authority (steering committee for major gaps)
5. Tracking and closure verification
