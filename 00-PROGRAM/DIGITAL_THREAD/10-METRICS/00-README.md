## Digital Thread Health Dashboard

See: `DT_HEALTH_DASHBOARD.md`

### Real-Time Metrics
- **Sync Status**: Current synchronization state (All systems, green/yellow/red)
- **Latency**: Data transfer delays (Target <1 minute for critical data)
- **Uptime**: System availability (Target 99.9%)
- **Active Alerts**: Critical issues requiring attention

### Integration Health
- PLM ↔ MBSE: Status, last sync, error count
- MBSE ↔ Digital Twin: Model updates, validation status
- MES ↔ ERP: EBOM↔MBOM sync, work instruction updates
- Fleet Data: Telemetry ingestion, anomaly detection

### Data Quality
- Completeness: % required fields populated (Target ≥95%)
- Accuracy: Validation pass rate (Target ≥99%)
- Consistency: Cross-system data alignment (Target 100%)
- Timeliness: Data freshness (age of data)

## Traceability Coverage

File: `TRACEABILITY_COVERAGE.csv`

### Coverage Dimensions
- Requirements to Model (Req ↔ SysML Block)
- Model to Verification (SysML Block ↔ Test Case)
- Verification to Results (Test Case ↔ Test Result)
- Results to Fleet (Test Result ↔ Operational Data)
- Fleet Feedback Linked (Operational Anomaly ↔ Design Change)

### Coverage Metrics
- **Overall Coverage**: % of requirements with complete trace
- **Gap Analysis**: Unlinked or orphaned items
- **Trend**: Coverage improvement over time
- **By Domain**: Coverage by subsystem or domain

### Target Thresholds
- Pre-PDR: ≥90% coverage
- Pre-CDR: ≥95% coverage
- Pre-TRR: ≥99% coverage
- Operations: 100% critical requirements traced to fleet

### Example Structure
```csv

Propulsion,189,185,180,175,15,92.6%
Structures,312,310,305,300,5,96.2%

## ROI Tracker

See: `ROI_TRACKER.md`

### Cost Avoidance
- **Reduced Rework**: Design issues found virtually vs. in hardware
  - Metric: % reduction in ECO (Engineering Change Order) count
  - Target: 20% reduction compared to baseline
- **Accelerated Certification**: Automated evidence generation
  - Metric: Time to prepare certification package
  - Target: 50% reduction in preparation time
- **Manufacturing Efficiency**: EBOM↔MBOM sync, reduced NCRs
  - Metric: % reduction in NCR count
  - Target: 15% reduction
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Fleet maintenance cost reduction
  - Metric: % reduction in unplanned maintenance events
  - Target: 30% reduction

### Time Savings
- **Design Cycle Time**: Requirements to validated design
  - Metric: Days from requirement to design validation
  - Target: 40% reduction
- **Test Correlation**: Automated twin validation
  - Metric: Hours to correlate test data with models
  - Target: 70% reduction (automated)
- **Traceability Analysis**: Automated impact analysis
  - Metric: Minutes to generate impact report
  - Target: 90% reduction (from days to minutes)

### Investment Tracking
- **Capital Investment**: Software licenses, infrastructure, integration
- **Operational Costs**: Maintenance, training, support
- **ROI Calculation**: (Total Savings - Total Investment) / Total Investment
- **Break-Even Point**: Month when cumulative savings exceed cumulative investment

### Example ROI Calculation
```
Year 1 Investment: $5M
Year 2 Investment: $4M
Year 3 Investment: $2M
Total Investment: $11M

Year 3 Annual Savings: $8M
Year 4 Annual Savings: $10M
Year 5 Annual Savings: $12M

Cumulative Savings (5 years): $30M+
ROI (5 years): (30M - 11M) / 11M = 173%
Break-Even: Month 42
```
