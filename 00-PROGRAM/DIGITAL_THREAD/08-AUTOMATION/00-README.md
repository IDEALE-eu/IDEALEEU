# 08-AUTOMATION

CI/CD pipelines, traceability automation, and validation scripts.

## Purpose

This directory contains automation scripts and pipelines for continuous integration, continuous deployment, automated traceability maintenance, and validation of the Digital Thread.

## Contents

- **00-README.md** - This file
- **CI_CD_PIPELINES/** - Model validation, twin build, release packaging
- **TRACEABILITY_BOT/** - Auto-link Req ↔ CI ↔ Test ↔ Anomaly
- **VALIDATION_SCRIPTS/** - End-to-end Digital Thread integrity checks

## CI/CD Pipelines

### Model Validation Pipeline
- SysML model syntax and consistency checks
- Requirements allocation verification (≥95% target)
- MBSE model completeness validation
- Interface definition consistency
- Automated test execution

### Digital Twin Build Pipeline
- Physics model build and validation
- ML model training and deployment
- Twin API deployment
- Integration testing
- Performance benchmarking

### Release Packaging Pipeline
- Configuration baseline snapshot
- Certification evidence packaging
- Document generation (automated)
- Release notes compilation
- Deployment to production

### Execution Schedule
- **Continuous**: On git commit/merge
- **Nightly**: Full regression suite
- **Weekly**: Performance and integration tests
- **On-Demand**: Manual trigger for specific validations

## Traceability Bot

### Automated Traceability Maintenance
- Requirement ↔ Model element linking
- Model ↔ Test case linking
- Test ↔ Verification result linking
- Anomaly ↔ Root cause linking
- Gap detection and alerting

### Traceability Rules
- Bidirectional link validation
- Orphaned requirement detection
- Unverified requirement alerting
- Coverage metrics computation

### Bot Actions
- Create missing links (with approval)
- Flag traceability gaps
- Generate traceability reports
- Send alerts for coverage drops
- Update traceability dashboards

## Validation Scripts

### End-to-End Integrity Checks
Location: `VALIDATION_SCRIPTS/`

Scripts:
- `interop_test.py` - Test data exchange between all systems
- `validate_traceability.py` - Verify end-to-end traceability
- `check_data_quality.py` - Data completeness and consistency
- `validate_digital_twin.py` - Twin model correlation with data
- `compliance_check.py` - Standards compliance verification

### Validation Frequency
- **Pre-Commit**: Syntax and basic checks
- **Nightly**: Full validation suite
- **Weekly**: Integration and interop tests
- **Stage Gate**: Comprehensive validation before gate

### Validation Reports
- Pass/fail summary
- Detailed error logs
- Trend analysis (improvement over time)
- Recommendations for remediation

## Tools and Technologies

### CI/CD Platforms
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI/CD
- Jenkins
- Azure DevOps

### Testing Frameworks
- pytest (Python)
- JUnit (Java)
- Selenium (UI testing)
- Postman/Newman (API testing)

### Automation Languages
- Python (primary)
- Bash scripting
- PowerShell (Windows)
- YAML/JSON (configuration)

## Automation Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Pipeline Success Rate**: Target ≥95%
- **Build Time**: Target <30 minutes
- **Test Coverage**: Target ≥80% code coverage
- **Traceability Coverage**: Target ≥99%
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: Target <1 hour
- **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**: Target <24 hours

### Dashboards
Location: 10-METRICS/
- Pipeline execution history
- Test results trends
- Traceability coverage over time
- Defect escape rate

## Integration with Digital Thread

### Upstream Integration
- Triggered by git commits (MBSE, code, documents)
- Ingests data from PLM, MBSE tools
- Monitors configuration changes

### Downstream Integration
- Updates traceability database
- Publishes validation results to dashboards
- Triggers alerts to stakeholders
- Updates digital twin models

### Notification System
- Email alerts for failures
- Slack/Teams integration
- Dashboard status updates
- Escalation for critical issues

## Best Practices

### Pipeline Design
- Fail fast (quick feedback)
- Parallel execution (speed)
- Idempotent (repeatable)
- Secure (secrets management)
- Auditable (logging)

### Script Development
- Version controlled (git)
- Documented (docstrings, README)
- Tested (unit tests for scripts)
- Modular (reusable components)
- Logged (execution traces)
