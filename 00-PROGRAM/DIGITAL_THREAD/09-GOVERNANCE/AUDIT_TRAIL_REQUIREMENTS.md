# Audit Trail Requirements

## Logging Requirements

### Events to be Logged

**Data Operations**
- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations
- Timestamp (UTC)
- User ID
- Data element UID
- Action type
- Old value (for updates/deletes)
- New value (for creates/updates)
- Reason for change (optional, but recommended)

**Access Events**
- Login/logout
- Failed login attempts
- Access to controlled technical data (ITAR/EAR)
- Export of controlled data
- Privilege escalation

**Configuration Changes**
- Baseline establishment
- Change request approval/rejection
- Configuration item modification
- Version control commits

**Administrative Actions**
- User account creation/modification/deletion
- Access rights changes
- System configuration changes
- Security policy updates

### Log Attributes

Mandatory fields for all log entries:
```yaml
log_entry:
  timestamp: "2025-03-15T14:30:00.123Z"  # ISO 8601, UTC
  user_id: "john.doe@idealeeu.eu"
  user_role: "Engineer"
  action: "UPDATE"
  data_uid: "SPEC-001234-V2.1"
  data_type: "Document"
  old_value: "Status=Draft"
  new_value: "Status=Approved"
  reason: "Completed peer review"
  ip_address: "192.168.1.100"
  session_id: "abc123def456"
  result: "SUCCESS"
```

## Log Storage and Retention

### Storage Architecture
- **Primary Storage**: Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- **Archive Storage**: Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) storage
- **Backup**: Daily backups, off-site storage
- **Replication**: Real-time replication to secondary site

### Retention Periods

| Log Type | Retention Period | Rationale |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| Active Program Data | Program lifetime | Ongoing traceability |
| Controlled Data Access | 10 years minimum | AS9100, ITAR |
| Configuration Changes | Program + 10 years | ECSS-M-ST-40 |
| Security Events | 7 years | ISO 27001 |
| Audit Logs | 10 years | Regulatory compliance |

### Archive Process
- Logs moved to archive after 2 years (configurable)
- Archived logs compressed and indexed
- Retrieval process documented
- Archive integrity verified annually

## Log Immutability

### Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM)
- Logs written to immutable storage
- No modification or deletion allowed
- Cryptographic hashing for integrity verification
- Tamper detection mechanisms

### Integrity Verification

**Hash Chain**:
Each log entry includes hash of previous entry, creating chain:
```
Entry_N.hash = SHA256(Entry_N.data + Entry_(N-1).hash)
```

**Periodic Verification**:
- Daily: Verify hash chain integrity
- Weekly: Full log audit (sample verification)
- Monthly: External verification (third-party)

**Tamper Detection**:
- Hash mismatch triggers alert
- Incident investigation initiated
- Security team notified
- Root cause analysis required

## Audit Log Access

### Access Control
- Read-only access for authorized personnel
- Security administrators: Full access
- Auditors: Read-only, filtered by scope
- Managers: Read-only, their domain
- Engineers: No direct access (use dashboards)

### Export and Reporting
- Audit reports generated on-demand
- Filters: Date range, user, action type, data element
- Export formats: CSV, JSON, PDF
- Export logged (audit of audits)

## Compliance Requirements

### AS9100
- Clause 8.5.2: Traceability
- Clause 8.5.6: Control of changes
- Audit trail supports quality record keeping

**Requirements**:
- Who did what, when, why
- Approval records
- Configuration changes documented
- Non-conformance tracking

### ECSS-M-ST-40 (Configuration Management)
- Configuration status accounting (CSA)
- Change control documentation
- Baseline audit trail

**Requirements**:
- Configuration item lifecycle
- Change request tracking
- Baseline establishment records
- Verification and validation evidence

### ISO 27001 (Information Security)
- A.12.4: Logging and monitoring
- A.18.1: Compliance with legal requirements

**Requirements**:
- Security event logging
- Log protection from tampering
- Regular log review
- Audit trail for compliance

### ITAR/EAR (Export Control)
- Access to controlled technical data logged
- Export events documented
- Audit trail for export compliance verification

**Requirements**:
- Who accessed controlled data
- When and from where (IP address)
- What data was accessed/exported
- Authorization verification

## Log Monitoring and Alerting

### Real-Time Alerts
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Access to highly sensitive data (e.g., ITAR)
- Failed login threshold exceeded
- Privilege escalation
- Bulk data export
- System configuration changes

### Alert Routing
- **Critical**: Immediate notification (SMS, phone)
- **High**: Email + dashboard alert (15 min)
- **Medium**: Dashboard alert (1 hour)
- **Low**: Daily summary email

### Incident Response
1. Alert triggered
2. Security team notified
3. Preliminary investigation (within 1 hour)
4. Incident classification (security breach, policy violation, false positive)
5. Response action (account lock, access revocation, investigation)
6. Root cause analysis
7. Remediation and closure
8. Lessons learned

## Audit Reviews

### Internal Audits
- **Weekly**: Security event log review
- **Monthly**: Configuration change audit
- **Quarterly**: Access control audit
- **Annual**: Comprehensive program audit

### External Audits
- AS9100 certification audit (annual)
- ISO 27001 certification audit (annual)
- Customer audits (as required)
- Regulatory audits (ITAR, EAR)

### Audit Process
1. Define audit scope (time period, domains)
2. Extract audit logs
3. Analyze for compliance
4. Identify findings (non-conformances, observations)
5. Report findings to management
6. Corrective action plans
7. Verify corrective actions
8. Close findings

## Reporting

### Standard Reports

**Daily Report**:
- Failed login attempts
- Security alerts
- System availability

**Weekly Report**:
- User activity summary
- Access to controlled data
- Configuration changes

**Monthly Report**:
- Compliance metrics
- Audit findings and status
- Trend analysis

**Quarterly Report**:
- Executive summary
- Key metrics and KPIs
- Recommendations for improvement

### Ad-Hoc Reports
- Incident investigation reports
- Forensic analysis
- Compliance evidence packages
- Legal discovery (if required)

## Technology Stack

### Logging Infrastructure
- **Collection**: Fluentd, Logstash
- **Storage**: Elasticsearch, Splunk
- **Visualization**: Kibana, Grafana
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty, Splunk alerts

### SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
- Splunk Enterprise Security
- IBM QRadar
- Microsoft Sentinel

### Log Analysis
- Automated anomaly detection (ML-based)
- Correlation rules (detect patterns)
- Threat intelligence integration

## Best Practices

- **Centralized Logging**: All systems log to central repository
- **Consistent Format**: Standardized log format (JSON)
- **Time Synchronization**: NTP for accurate timestamps
- **Secure Transport**: TLS encryption for log transmission
- **Regular Review**: Don't just collect logs, review them
- **Automation**: Automate log analysis and alerting
- **Training**: Train staff on audit trail importance
- **Testing**: Regularly test log integrity and alerting
