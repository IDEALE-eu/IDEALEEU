## Purpose

This directory establishes the governance framework for the Digital Thread, including data ownership, access control policies, and audit trail requirements for compliance.

## Contents

- **00-README.md** - This file
- **DATA_OWNERSHIP.md** - RACI by domain (Avionics, Propulsion, etc.)
- **ACCESS_CONTROL_POLICY.md** - ITAR/EAR, role-based access

- **Propulsion**: Propulsion Chief Engineer (Accountable), Propulsion Engineering (Responsible)
- **Systems Engineering**: Chief Engineer (Accountable), Systems Engineers (Responsible)
- **Digital Twin**: Head of Digital Engineering (Accountable), Digital Thread Team (Responsible)

### Cross-Cutting Data
- **Configuration Management**: Program Configuration Manager
- **Quality Data**: Head of Quality
- **Fleet Data**: Head of Fleet Operations
- **Security Metadata**: Head of Information Security

## Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
See: `ACCESS_CONTROL_POLICY.md`

Role Categories:

- **Manufacturing Roles**: Technician, Manufacturing Engineer, Production Manager
- **Operations Roles**: Operator, Maintenance Crew, Fleet Manager
- **Quality Roles**: Quality Inspector, Quality Engineer, Quality Manager
- **Admin Roles**: System Administrator, Security Administrator

### Data Classification
- **Public**: Non-sensitive, publicly releasable
- **Internal**: Company confidential
- **Controlled**: ITAR/EAR restricted
- **Classified**: Government classified (if applicable)

### Access Levels
- **Read**: View data
- **Write**: Create/modify data
- **Approve**: Authorize changes
- **Admin**: Manage access rights

## ITAR/EAR Compliance

### Controlled Technical Data
- Flagged at UID level (06-DATA_MANAGEMENT/UID_STRATEGY.md)
- Access restricted to authorized personnel
- Export compliance verified before data exchange
- Audit trail of all access

### Compliance Verification
- Annual ITAR/EAR training (mandatory)
- Access reviews (quarterly)
- Export compliance audits (annual)
- Incident reporting and investigation

## Audit Trail Requirements

### Audit Logging
See: `AUDIT_TRAIL_REQUIREMENTS.md`

Logged Events:
- Data creation, modification, deletion
- Access to controlled data
- Configuration changes
- Approval actions
- System administration actions

### Log Attributes
- Timestamp (UTC)
- User ID
- Action type
- Data element UID
- Old value / New value
- Reason for change (if applicable)

### Log Retention
- **Active Data**: Logs retained for lifetime of program
- **Archived Data**: Logs retained per regulatory requirements
- **AS9100 Requirement**: Minimum 10 years
- **ECSS Requirement**: Project lifetime + 10 years

### Log Immutability
- Write-once, read-many (WORM) storage
- Cryptographic hashing for integrity
- Tamper detection mechanisms
- Regular integrity audits

## Compliance Requirements

### AS9100
- Configuration management (Clause 8.5.6)
- Traceability (Clause 8.5.2)
- Control of changes (Clause 8.5.6)
- Audit trail for quality records

### ECSS-M-ST-40
- Configuration identification
- Configuration status accounting (CSA)
- Change control documentation
- Audit of baselines

### ISO 27001
- Access control (A.9)
- Operations security (A.12)
- Compliance (A.18)
- Audit logging (A.12.4)

## Governance Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Access Review Completion**: Target 100% quarterly
- **Audit Trail Integrity**: Target 100% (zero tampered logs)
- **ITAR Training Compliance**: Target 100% current
- **Data Ownership Coverage**: Target 100% of domains
- **Policy Violations**: Target zero critical violations

### Reporting
