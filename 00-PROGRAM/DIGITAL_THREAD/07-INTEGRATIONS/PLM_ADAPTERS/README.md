# PLM_ADAPTERS

CAD/CAE â†” PLM integration adapters.

## Purpose

Adapters for integrating CAD, CAE, and other engineering tools with Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems.

## Adapters

### Windchill Adapter
- CAD data (Creo, SolidWorks)
- BOM management
- Document management
- Change management

### 3DEXPERIENCE Adapter
- CATIA integration
- Simulation data (SIMULIA)
- Collaborative design
- BOM management

### Teamcenter Adapter
- NX CAD integration
- Requirements management
- BOM and change management

## Integration Patterns

- **Synchronous**: Real-time CAD check-in/check-out
- **Asynchronous**: Nightly BOM synchronization
- **Event-Driven**: Trigger on design release, ECO approval
