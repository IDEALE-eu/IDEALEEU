# 07-INTEGRATIONS

PLM, MES/ERP, fleet data, and certification evidence adapters.

## Purpose

This directory contains integration adapters and connectors that enable data exchange between the Digital Thread and external systems (PLM/PDM, MES/ERP, fleet data systems, certification tools).

## Contents

- **00-README.md** - This file
- **PLM_ADAPTERS/** - CAD/CAE ↔ PLM integration (Windchill, 3DEXPERIENCE)
- **MES_ERP_CONNECTORS/** - EBOM↔MBOM sync, work instructions, NCR flow
- **FLEET_DATA_INGEST/** - API specs for 01-FLEET/OPERATIONAL_DATA_HUB integration
- **CERTIFICATION_EVIDENCE_BRIDGE/** - Auto-package DO-178C/ECSS artifacts → CONFIG_MGMT/RELEASES/

## Integration Architecture

### Data Exchange Patterns
- **Synchronous**: RESTful APIs for real-time queries
- **Asynchronous**: Message queues (Kafka, MQTT) for event-driven updates
- **Batch**: Scheduled file transfers (SFTP, S3) for bulk data

### Standards Used
- **OSLC**: Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration
- **STEP AP242**: CAD/CAE data exchange
- **ReqIF**: Requirements interchange
- **OData**: Query protocol
- **JSON/XML**: Data serialization

## Integration Catalog

### PLM_ADAPTERS
- Windchill adapter (CAD, BOM, documents)
- 3DEXPERIENCE adapter (CAD, simulation, BOM)
- Siemens Teamcenter adapter (CAD, BOM, requirements)
- PTC Creo integration (parametric CAD)
- CATIA integration (CAD, FEM)

### MES_ERP_CONNECTORS
- EBOM to MBOM synchronization
- Work instruction generation
- NCR (Non-Conformance Report) workflow
- Quality data integration (CoC, FAI, PPAP)
- Supplier data exchange

### FLEET_DATA_INGEST
- Aircraft telemetry ingestion
- Spacecraft telemetry processing
- Maintenance event capture
- Usage data aggregation
- Anomaly detection pipeline

### CERTIFICATION_EVIDENCE_BRIDGE
- DO-178C software evidence
- DO-254 hardware evidence
- ECSS verification artifacts
- Traceability report generation
- Compliance package assembly

## Integration Monitoring

### Health Metrics
- **Availability**: Uptime % for each integration
- **Latency**: Data transfer time (target <1 minute for critical data)
- **Throughput**: Messages/records per second
- **Error Rate**: Failed transactions percentage (target <1%)

### Monitoring Dashboards
Location: 10-METRICS/DT_HEALTH_DASHBOARD.md
- Real-time integration status
- Data flow visualization
- Error logs and alerts
- Performance trends

## Security and Compliance

### Access Control
- OAuth 2.0 or API keys for authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ITAR/EAR compliance for controlled data
- Audit logging of all data transfers

### Data Encryption
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- AES-256 for data at rest
- Key management via HSM or cloud KMS
