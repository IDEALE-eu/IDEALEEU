# SEALING - Software, Embedded Systems, AI Lifecycle, and Network Governance

## Overview

SEALING provides comprehensive data structures and integration patterns for managing the complete lifecycle of software, embedded systems, AI models, and network infrastructure within the IDEALE-EU program.

## Purpose

SEALING bridges the gap between:
- **PLM/CAx** artifacts (CAD, CAE, CAM, CAO, CMP, CAP)
- **Software Components** with full SBOM and provenance
- **Embedded Systems** with hardware specifications and firmware
- **AI Models** with training, deployment, and monitoring
- **Network Infrastructure** with security and governance

## Module Structure

### 1. Software Lifecycle (`types/software.ts`)
- Software component identification and versioning
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) - SPDX/CycloneDX formats
- Build artifacts with cryptographic signatures
- Dependency management with license tracking
- Security scanning (SAST/DAST/dependency)
- DO-178C certification support
- SLSA provenance (levels 0-4)

### 2. Embedded Systems (`types/embedded.ts`)
- MCU specifications (ARM, RISC-V, x86)
- Memory configuration with ECC support
- Communication interfaces (CAN, Ethernet, RS485)
- Safety features (watchdog, redundancy, self-test)
- OTA (Over-The-Air) updates with rollback
- Diagnostics with DTC and telemetry

### 3. AI Lifecycle (`types/ai.ts`)
- Model training with experiment tracking
- Model evaluation with performance metrics
- Edge deployment optimization (TFLite, ONNX)
- Drift detection and monitoring
- Explainability (SHAP, LIME)
- Ethics assessment (bias, privacy, compliance)

### 4. Network Governance (`types/network.ts`)
- Network nodes with roles and capabilities
- Service deployment with containers
- Security (firewall, IDS, encryption)
- Network topology with segments
- Governance policies (RBAC, data governance)
- Incident response planning

### 5. DevSecOps (`types/devsecops.ts`)
- CI/CD pipelines with stages and jobs
- Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling)
- Pipeline metrics and failure analysis
- Automated rollback on failure

### 6. Security (`types/security.ts`)
- Security policies with controls
- Threat modeling (STRIDE methodology)
- Risk assessment with mitigations
- Policy exceptions with compensating controls

### 7. Integration (`types/integration.ts`)
- Integrated systems orchestration
- Integration points with data contracts
- System monitoring (Prometheus, ELK, Jaeger)
- SLOs/SLIs with error budgets
- Promotion gates between environments

## Integration with IDEALE-EU

### Connection to PRDs
Each SEALING component references its parent PRD:
- Software components → Domain PRD
- Embedded systems → Product/Subproduct PRD
- AI models → Domain PRD (IIS, EDI)
- Network nodes → Infrastructure PRD

### Connection to UTCS
All SEALING components are anchored to UTCS (Universal Traceability Coordinate System):
```
utcs_ref: "UTCS-{DOMAIN}/{COMPONENT}@{VERSION}"
```

### Connection to PLM/CAx
SEALING integrates with PLM artifacts:
- Software → CAP (Planning), CMP (Compliance)
- Embedded → CAD (Design), CAE (Analysis)
- AI Models → CAO (Optimization), CAI (Integration)
- Network → CAS (Services), CAV (Validation)

## Examples

Complete examples are provided in the `examples/` directory:
- **AMPEL360-AIR-T-H2-System**: Complete hydrogen-electric aircraft system
- **Flight-Controller-Integration**: Embedded system with AI predictive maintenance
- **Edge-Gateway-Deployment**: Network node with services

## Schemas

JSON Schemas for validation are provided in the `schemas/` directory:
- `software-component.schema.json`
- `embedded-system.schema.json`
- `ai-model.schema.json`
- `network-node.schema.json`
- `integrated-system.schema.json`

## Documentation

Additional documentation in the `docs/` directory:
- `integration-guide.md`: How to integrate SEALING with existing systems
- `best-practices.md`: Best practices for using SEALING modules
- `compliance-mapping.md`: Mapping to aerospace standards
- `api-reference.md`: Complete API reference

## Standards Compliance

SEALING supports compliance with:
- **Software**: DO-178C, SLSA, SPDX, CycloneDX
- **Embedded**: DO-254, IEC 61508, ISO 26262
- **AI**: EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001
- **Network**: NIST 800-53, DO-326A, ISO 27001
- **Security**: STRIDE, DREAD, NIST CSF

## Usage

See the examples directory for complete usage patterns. Basic usage:

```typescript
import { SoftwareComponent, EmbeddedSystem, AIModel, NetworkNode } from './types';

// Define components
const firmware: SoftwareComponent = { /* ... */ };
const controller: EmbeddedSystem = { /* ... */ };
const aiModel: AIModel = { /* ... */ };
const gateway: NetworkNode = { /* ... */ };

// Create integrated system
const integratedSystem = {
  system_id: 'INT-001',
  utcs_ref: 'UTCS-LCC/INT-001@1.0.0',
  components: {
    software: [firmware],
    embedded: [controller],
    ai_models: [aiModel],
    network_nodes: [gateway]
  }
};
```
