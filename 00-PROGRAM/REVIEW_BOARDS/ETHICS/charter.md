## 6. MAL-EEM Gate Review Process

### P0 Charter Gate
**Inputs**: Problem statement, harm taxonomy  
**Review**: Scope documented, harms mapped, stakeholders identified  
**Decision**: Go / No-Go

### P1 Data Gate
**Inputs**: Data Sheet, DPIA  
**Review**: Provenance complete, legal basis, PII minimized, retention policy  
**Decision**: Data OK / Conditional / Rejected

### P2 Model Gate
**Inputs**: Model Card, evaluation plan  
**Review**: Metrics meet thresholds, uncertainty spec, hazards linked  
**Decision**: Train OK / Conditional / Rejected

### P3 EEM Gate
**Inputs**: Scriptbook, UX spec  
**Review**: No anthropomorphism, accessibility passed, escalation path defined  
**Decision**: UI OK / Conditional / Rejected

### P4 Red-Team Gate
**Inputs**: Red-team report, fixes  
**Review**: High-risk findings closed, kill-switch validated  
**Decision**: Pre-Deploy / Conditional / Rejected

### REL Gate
**Inputs**: Safety Case, sign-offs, IEF manifest  
**Review**: IEF complete, signatures verified, NCR-High = 0  
**Decision**: Release / Conditional / Rejected

## 7. Ethical Principles

### Fairness
- Bias mitigation across demographic slices
- Parity metrics within budget
- Representation in training data

### Transparency
- Explainable decisions
- Uncertainty quantification
- Clear limitations

### Privacy
- Data minimization
- Consent mechanisms
- PII protection

### Accountability
- Human oversight
- Audit trails
- Escalation paths

### Safety
- Hazard identification
- Risk mitigation
- Kill-switch procedures

### Human Dignity
- No deceptive anthropomorphism
- No manipulation
- No covert persuasion

---

## 8. EEM Guardrails Enforcement

The Committee enforces:
- ‚ùå No claims of feelings, embodiment, or self-awareness
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimers for non-deterministic guidance
- üìö Citations or uncertainty ranges when applicable

**Violation Response**: Immediate deployment halt, corrective action required

---

## 9. Bias and Fairness Monitoring

### Metrics
- Parity delta ‚â§ 1.5% per demographic slice
- Regression budget tracked
- Performance by slice documented

### Review Frequency
- Pre-deployment (P2 gate)
- Post-deployment (quarterly)
- After incidents

### Remediation
- Retraining with balanced data
- Algorithm adjustment
- Deployment restriction

---

## 10. Decision Documentation

All Ethics Committee decisions recorded with:
- Decision ID (ETH-YYYY-NNN)
- UTCS thread ID
- MAL-EEM gate
- Model/system identifier
- Rationale
- Voting record
- Conditions or requirements

**Storage**: `REVIEW_BOARDS/ETHICS/decisions/`

---

## 11. Red Team Coordination

The Committee oversees red team activities:
- Adversarial testing
- Bias probing
- Misuse scenarios
- Anthropomorphism testing
- Persuasion detection

**Red Team Reports**: Reviewed at P4 gate

---

## 12. Interfaces

- Coordinate on hazard analysis

### DPO
- Joint review of data practices
- Coordinate on privacy and consent

### CCB
