## "To Scale" Methodology

### The Scaling Challenge

**Physics Don't Scale Linearly**: When moving from prototype to full-scale production:

- **Aerodynamics**: Reynolds number effects change flow characteristics
- **Combustion**: Flame stability and mixing patterns shift at scale
- **Structures**: Stress distributions and buckling modes differ
- **Thermal**: Heat transfer rates and thermal gradients vary

### IDEALE-EU "To Scale" Approach

    style H fill:#10B981
```

**Key Principles**:

1. **Re-validate each CAx phase** when scaling
2. **QS-anchor** both prototype and production data
3. **Digital twin predictions** must match physical reality
4. **Federated learning** captures fleet-wide scaling effects
5. **Configuration management** ensures traceability across scale transitions

### Example: H2 Propulsion Scaling

**Prototype (ground demonstrator)**:
- 100 kW fuel cell system
- Laboratory-scale cryogenic tank
- Benchtop testing environment

**Production (commercial aircraft)**:
- 10 MW fuel cell system (100x power)
- Flight-qualified LH2 tank (1000x volume)
- Altitude and thermal cycling requirements

**Scaling Issues Addressed**:
- Cryogenic boil-off rates (non-linear with tank size)
- Fuel cell stack thermal management (different cooling strategies)
- Hydrogen distribution pressure drops (pipe diameter optimization)
- Safety systems (detection zones scale differently)

**TFA Domain Flow**:
- **CQH**: Hydrogen system design and cryogenics
- **PPP**: Integration with propulsion architecture  
- **CAE**: Thermal and flow simulations at both scales
- **CAV**: Testing campaign with QS-anchored evidence
- **CMP**: Configuration control through scaling transition
- **LIB**: Component traceability from prototype parts to production

- **QS anchoring** of all deliverables for tamper-proof audit trails

## Best Practices

### Design Phase (CAD/CAE/CAI/CAO)

- ✅ Use parametric models for easy scaling adjustments
- ✅ QS-anchor major design reviews and configuration baselines
- ✅ Document scaling assumptions and similarity parameters
- ✅ Plan for "to scale" validation early

### Manufacturing Phase (CAM/CAP)

- ✅ Simulate manufacturing processes before tooling investment
- ✅ Validate DFM rules with actual production data
- ✅ Track tooling configurations with digital passports
- ✅ Use federated learning for process optimization

### Validation Phase (CAV)

- ✅ Correlate simulations (CAE) with test data
- ✅ Build certification evidence packages incrementally
- ✅ QS-anchor all test results for regulatory submission
- ✅ Maintain "frozen context" for certification basis

### Configuration Phase (CMP)

- ✅ Implement rigorous ECR/ECO/CCB processes
- ✅ Link changes back to affected CAx phases
- ✅ Maintain as-designed vs as-built reconciliation
- ✅ Use LIB domain for complete traceability
