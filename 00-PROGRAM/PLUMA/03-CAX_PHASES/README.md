# 9-Phase CAx Lifecycle Model

## Overview

PLUMA orchestrates aerospace programs through 9 phases, each explicitly designed for industrial scalability. The "x" in CAx means "to scale" — emphasizing automation, parallelization, and replicability.

### MAL Services

Each phase leverages MAL (PLUMA Architecture Layer) services that align with the canonical TFA flow:
- **QS** (Quantum Superposition): Pre-event state capture and scheduling
- **FWD** (Future/Waves Dynamics): Predictive modeling and forward propagation
- **UE** (Unit Element): Classical fundamental units and unified engines
- **FE** (Federation Entanglement): Distributed multi-party coordination
- **CB** (Classical Bit): Post-event reality anchoring and cognitive bridging
- **QB** (Qubit): Quantum computation strategies

> **Note**: MAL service names reflect both canonical TFA meanings and PLUMA-specific implementations (e.g., CB as "Cognitive Bridge" for AI services, QS as scheduling orchestration of quantum superposition states).
