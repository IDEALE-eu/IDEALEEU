## Safety Standards

### IEC 61508 Overview

#### Safety Lifecycle
1. Concept
2. Overall scope definition
3. Hazard and risk analysis
4. Overall safety requirements
5. Safety requirements allocation
6. Design and development (E/E/PE, software, other)
7. Integration
8. Installation and commissioning
9. Validation
10. Operation and maintenance
11. Modification
12. Decommissioning

#### Safety Integrity Levels (SIL)
- **SIL 4**: Very high (catastrophic consequences)
- **SIL 3**: High (serious consequences)
- **SIL 2**: Medium (significant consequences)
- **SIL 1**: Low (minor consequences)

Requirements rigor increases with SIL (documentation, verification, independence).

### Applicability to Aerospace Ground Systems

- **Test Equipment**: Automated test systems (SIL 1-2)
- **Ground Support Equipment**: Handling, fueling, transport (SIL 2-3)
- **Factory Automation**: Robotics, AGVs (SIL 1-2)
- **Mission Control**: Spacecraft commanding (high integrity, not necessarily SIL-rated)

## Security Standards

### ISO/IEC 27001 Overview

#### ISMS Processes
- Context establishment
- Leadership and commitment

2. Development phase (risk assessment, security design)
3. Production phase (secure manufacturing, supply chain)
4. Operations and maintenance (monitoring, updates, incident response)
5. End of life (secure decommissioning)

#### Risk Assessment
- **Threat Scenarios**: Identify potential attacks (tampering, eavesdropping, denial-of-service)
- **Attack Feasibility**: Rate difficulty of attack (low, medium, high)
- **Impact**: Assess consequences (safety, privacy, financial, operational)
- **Risk**: Combine feasibility and impact

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework

#### Core Functions
1. **Identify**: Asset management, risk assessment, governance
2. **Protect**: Access control, training, data security, protective technology
3. **Detect**: Anomaly detection, continuous monitoring
4. **Respond**: Incident response, communications, analysis, mitigation
5. **Recover**: Recovery planning, improvements, communications

### NIST SP 800-171

#### Control Families

- Audit and Accountability (9)
- Configuration Management (9)
- Identification and Authentication (11)
- Incident Response (3)
- Maintenance (6)
- Media Protection (9)
- Personnel Security (2)
- Physical Protection (6)

- System and Communications Protection (17)
- System and Information Integrity (6)

## Ground System Safety

### Hazards
- **Electrical**: High voltage, arc flash
- **Mechanical**: Pinch points, falling objects, lifting
- **Pressure**: Compressed gas, vacuum systems
- **Thermal**: Hot surfaces, cryogenic fluids
- **Chemical**: Propellants, solvents, acids
- **Radiation**: X-ray machines, RF transmitters

### Safety Measures
- Hazard analysis (HAZOP, PHA)
- Safety-rated interlocks and guards
- Emergency stop (E-stop) systems
- Personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Training and procedures
- Permits and authorizations

## Ground System Security

### Threats
- **External Attackers**: Hackers, nation-states, terrorists
- **Insiders**: Disgruntled employees, careless users
- **Supply Chain**: Compromised hardware/software
- **Physical**: Unauthorized access to facilities

### Security Measures
- **Access Control**: Badges, biometrics, security guards
- **Network Security**: Firewalls, VPNs, segmentation
- **Endpoint Security**: Antivirus, host firewalls, patching
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring**: SIEM, intrusion detection, log analysis
- **Incident Response**: Playbooks, forensics, recovery

## Key Deliverables

### Safety

2. **Hazard Analysis** - HAZOP, PHA, FMEA
3. **Safety Requirements** - Derived from hazard analysis
4. **Safety Case** - Argument for acceptable safety
5. **Safety Validation** - Test evidence

5. **Incident Response Plan** - Procedures for handling incidents
6. **Compliance Evidence** - NIST 800-171, ISO 27001 compliance

## Compliance Requirements

- Ground systems safety per IEC 61508 or equivalent
- IT systems security per ISO/IEC 27001 or NIST frameworks
- Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) per NIST SP 800-171
- Risk assessments conducted and risks mitigated
- Regular audits and assessments

## Integration with Other Standards

### Aircraft
- Ground systems support DO-178C/DO-254 development
- Test equipment qualified per DO-330
- Security protects certification data

### Spacecraft
- Ground segment (mission control, ground stations)
- GSE safety per ECSS-Q-ST-40C
- Data security for spacecraft commanding

## Best Practices

- Safety and security by design (not bolted on)
- Regular risk assessments
- Training and awareness programs
- Incident response drills
- Defense in depth (multiple layers)
- Principle of least privilege

## Common Pitfalls

- Safety/security as afterthought
- Inadequate risk assessment
- Weak access controls
- Poor patch management
- Lack of monitoring and detection
- Insufficient incident response capability
