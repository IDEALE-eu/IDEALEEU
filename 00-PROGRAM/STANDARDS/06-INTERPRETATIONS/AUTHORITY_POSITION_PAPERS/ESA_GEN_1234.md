## ESA General Requirements - Production Assurance for Space Systems

**Document**: ESA GEN-1234 (Example)  
**Date**: 2024  
**Authority**: ESA (European Space Agency)  
**Status**: Example Document

## Purpose

This document provides ESA's expectations for Production Assurance (PA) on ESA-funded spacecraft programs. It clarifies how ECSS Product Assurance standards should be applied and what ESA Independent Product Assurance (IPA) will verify.

## Scope

Applicable to:
- ESA-funded spacecraft development programs
- Prime contractors and subcontractors
- All spacecraft subsystems and payload instruments
- Ground segment equipment (where specified)

## Key Requirements

### 1. ECSS Compliance

All programs shall comply with applicable ECSS standards:
- **ECSS-Q-ST-20C**: Quality Assurance
- **ECSS-Q-ST-30C**: Dependability
- **ECSS-Q-ST-40C**: Safety
- **ECSS-Q-ST-60C**: EEE Components
- **ECSS-Q-ST-70C**: Materials, Mechanical Parts and Processes
- **ECSS-Q-ST-80C**: Software Product Assurance

### 2. Tailoring

- Tailoring allowed with justification
- Tailored Requirements List (TRL) required
- ESA approval of tailoring before implementation
- No tailoring of safety-critical requirements without strong justification

### 3. Product Assurance Organization

**Contractor PA**:
- Dedicated PA organization independent of project/development
- PA Manager with direct reporting to company management
- PA engineers assigned to major subsystems
- PA represented in all major reviews

**ESA IPA (Independent Product Assurance)**:
- ESA PA representative monitors contractor PA
- Access to all facilities, data, meetings
- Reports findings and non-conformances
- Participates in reviews and audits

### 4. Product Assurance Plan

**PA Plan Required**:
- Overall Product Assurance Plan (PAP)
- Sub-plans: Quality, Reliability, Safety, EEE, Materials
- Submitted at Kick-Off (Phase B start)
- Updated at major milestones (PDR, CDR)

**Content**:
- PA organization and responsibilities
- Applicable standards and tailoring
- PA activities by lifecycle phase
- Review and audit plans
- Non-conformance management
- Supplier PA requirements

### 5. Quality Assurance

**Quality Management System**:
- ISO 9001 certified (minimum)
- Preferably EN9100 / AS9100 for aerospace
- QMS audit by ESA or designated body

**Quality Activities**:
- Procedures and work instructions documented
- Process control and monitoring
- Inspection and testing per plans
- Non-conformance management
- Corrective and preventive actions (CAPA)
- Management reviews

### 6. EEE Components

**Parts Selection**:
- Use European Preferred Parts List (EPPL) where possible
- Non-preferred parts require justification and approval
- Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) requires extensive screening

**Parts Control**:
- Parts procurement quality requirements
- Counterfeit parts prevention
- Receiving inspection
- Storage and handling (ESD control)
- Traceability

### 7. Materials and Processes

**Materials Selection**:
- Materials qualified per ECSS-Q-ST-70C
- Outgassing per ASTM E595 (TML ≤ 1.0%, CVCM ≤ 0.1%)
- Flammability per ECSS-Q-ST-70C

**Process Control**:
- Critical processes qualified (welding, bonding, coating)
- Operator qualification and certification
- Process monitoring and control
- Non-destructive testing (NDT) where required

### 8. Software Product Assurance

**Software PA per ECSS-Q-ST-80C**:
- Software PA Plan (SPAP)
- Software requirements and design reviews
- Code inspections and static analysis
- Test witnessing and results review
- Configuration management oversight
- Software quality metrics

### 9. Reviews and Audits

**ESA Reviews**:
- Mission Definition Review (MDR)
- Preliminary Design Review (PDR)
- Critical Design Review (CDR)
- Qualification Review (QR)
- Acceptance Review (AR)
- Flight Readiness Review (FRR)
- Operational Readiness Review (ORR)

**PA Audits**:
- Process audits (QMS, PA procedures)
- Product audits (hardware, software, documentation)
- Supplier audits
- Functional Configuration Audit (FCA)
- Physical Configuration Audit (PCA)

### 10. Non-Conformances

**Non-Conformance Reporting (NCR)**:
- All non-conformances documented in NCR system
- Classification (minor, major, critical)
- Root cause analysis
- Corrective action plan
- Material Review Board (MRB) disposition
- ESA IPA notified of major/critical NCRs

**MRB Dispositions**:
- **Use as-is**: Accept without rework
- **Rework**: Repair to meet requirements
- **Repair**: Modify to alternative acceptable configuration
- **Scrap**: Discard and replace

### 11. Supplier Management

**Supplier Selection**:
- Supplier evaluation and approval
- ISO 9001 or equivalent required
- Supplier audits before contract award

**Supplier Monitoring**:
- Supplier quality agreements
- Regular performance reviews
- Supplier audits (annual or as needed)
- Supplier corrective actions tracked

### 12. Radiation Assurance (if applicable)

For missions with significant radiation environment:
- Radiation Assurance Plan
- EEE parts radiation testing (TID, SEE, DD)
- Radiation analysis and prediction
- Mitigation design (shielding, EDAC, redundancy)

### 13. Cleanroom Operations (if applicable)

For spacecraft AIT:
- Cleanroom per ISO 14644 (Class 7 or 8 typical)
- Contamination control procedures
- ESD control per ANSI/ESD S20.20
- Particle monitoring
- Cleanliness verification

### 14. Documentation

**PA Documentation Deliverables**:
- Product Assurance Plan and sub-plans
- FMECA, FTA, reliability predictions
- Materials and Processes List (MPL)
- Preferred Parts List (PPL)
- Non-Conformance Reports (NCRs)
- Audit reports
- Verification and test reports
- Product Assurance Summary Report (end of project)

### 15. Lessons Learned

- Capture lessons learned throughout project
- Share with ESA and other programs
- Incorporate into future programs
- Contribute to ECSS standards evolution

## ESA IPA Interface

**Responsibilities**:
- Monitor contractor PA implementation
- Review PA documentation
- Participate in reviews and audits
- Witness critical tests and inspections
- Issue findings and recommendations
- Approve major PA decisions (waivers, NCR dispositions)

**Communication**:
- Regular PA meetings (monthly or as needed)
- Findings reported in writing
- Escalation process for unresolved issues

## Compliance Verification

ESA verifies PA compliance through:
- Document reviews
- Process audits
- Product inspections
- Test witnessing
- Review participation
- Supplier audits (with contractor)

Non-compliance may result in:
- Findings requiring corrective action
- Withholding of milestone payments
- Project delays until resolved
