## Safety Information Bulletin - Cybersecurity Considerations for Civil Aviation

**Document**: SIB 2020-08  
**Date**: 2020  
**Authority**: EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency)  
**Status**: Current

## Purpose

This Safety Information Bulletin (SIB) provides guidance on cybersecurity considerations for civil aviation, particularly for connected aircraft and systems exposed to external threats.

## Scope

Applicable to:
- Type Certificate (TC) applicants
- Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) applicants
- Part 21 Design Organization Approvals (DOA)
- Operators introducing connected systems

## Key Points

### 1. Cybersecurity Risk Assessment

- Perform cybersecurity risk assessment per DO-326A
- Identify assets (functions, data, interfaces)
- Identify threats (external attacks, insider threats, supply chain)
- Assess vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- Determine risk (likelihood × consequence)

### 2. Airworthiness Security Process (ASRP)

Follow DO-326A Airworthiness Security Process:
- Security Planning
- Security Requirements Development
- Security Design and Implementation
- Security Verification and Validation
- Continuing Airworthiness Security

### 3. Connected Aircraft Considerations

For aircraft with external connectivity (Wi-Fi, cellular, satcom):
- Segment networks (isolate safety-critical from non-critical)
- Implement authentication and encryption
- Monitor for intrusions
- Plan for security updates

### 4. Integration with Existing Standards

Cybersecurity integrates with existing certification basis:
- **ARP4754A**: Security as part of system development
- **DO-178C**: Secure software development practices
- **DO-254**: Hardware security features
- **25.1309**: Security failures considered in safety assessment

### 5. Security Development Assurance Levels

Similar to DAL, but based on security risk:
- High security risk → stringent security controls
- Medium security risk → moderate security controls
- Low security risk → basic security controls

### 6. Continuing Airworthiness

- Security monitoring in service
- Vulnerability management process
- Security update process (patches, configuration changes)
- Incident response procedures

## Compliance Expectations

EASA expects:
- Cybersecurity addressed for TC/STC applications involving connected systems
- DO-326A process followed
- Security assessment submitted with certification data package
- Security validation testing performed
- Continuing airworthiness security procedures established

## Related Standards

- **DO-326A**: Airworthiness Security Process Specification
- **DO-355**: Information Security Guidance for Continuing Airworthiness
- **DO-356A**: Airworthiness Security Methods and Considerations
- **ISO 21434**: Road vehicles - Cybersecurity engineering (reference for ground systems)
