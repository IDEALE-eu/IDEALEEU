Systems engineering standards for aircraft development.

## Overview

This directory contains standards and guidance for systems engineering processes in aircraft development, focusing on ARP4754A and ARP4761.

## Applicable Standards

### ARP4754A - Guidelines for Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems
- **Scope**: End-to-end aircraft and systems development lifecycle
- **Key Topics**:
  - Requirements capture and management
  - System architecture development
  - Verification and validation planning
  - Configuration management
  - Process assurance
  - Safety assessment coordination
  - Certification liaison

- **Lifecycle Processes**:
  1. Aircraft function development
  2. Allocation to systems
  3. System implementation
  4. Integration and verification
  5. Certification and airworthiness

### ARP4761 - Guidelines and Methods for Conducting the Safety Assessment Process
- **Scope**: Safety assessment processes throughout development
- **Key Activities**:
  - Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA)
  - Preliminary System Safety Assessment (PSSA)
  - System Safety Assessment (SSA)
  - Common Cause Analysis (CCA)

- **Methods**:
  - Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
  - Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
  - Dependence Diagrams
  - Markov Analysis
  - Common Mode Analysis
  - Zonal Safety Analysis

## Integration with Other Standards

- **DO-178C** - Software development feeds into system integration
- **DO-254** - Hardware assurance coordinates with system safety
- **DO-160** - Environmental test plans derived from system requirements

## Key Deliverables

1. **PSAC** - Plan for Software Aspects of Certification
2. **PHAC** - Plan for Hardware Aspects of Certification
3. **SSP** - System Safety Program Plan
4. **FHA** - Functional Hazard Assessment
5. **PSSA** - Preliminary System Safety Assessment
6. **SSA** - System Safety Assessment
7. **CCA** - Common Cause Analysis

## Compliance Requirements

- System development shall follow ARP4754A guidelines
- Safety assessment shall be conducted per ARP4761
- DALs assigned based on failure condition severity
- Verification activities scaled to DAL
- Independence requirements met per assigned DAL

## Tools and Templates

- See 05-MAPPINGS/COMPLIANCE_MATRIX_TEMPLATES/ for ARP4754A compliance matrix
- See 05-MAPPINGS/CHECKLISTS/ for PDR/CDR verification
- FTA/FMEA tools must be qualified if used for certification
