# HUMAN_FACTORS

Human factors and flight deck design standards.

## Overview

This directory contains standards for human factors engineering and flight deck design, ensuring pilot interaction with aircraft systems is safe, efficient, and intuitive.

## Applicable Standards

### EASA CS-25 Annex II - Human Factors Certification Criteria
- **Scope**: Human factors requirements for large aircraft certification
- **Key Areas**:
  - Flight deck design and layout
  - Controls and displays
  - Alerting system design
  - Pilot workload assessment
  - Error tolerance and crew resource management

### FAA AC 25.1302-1 - Flight Deck Design Guidance
- **Purpose**: Compliance methods for 14 CFR 25.1302 (installed equipment)
- **Topics**:
  - Information management principles
  - Control/display integration
  - Consistency and standardization
  - Error prevention and detection

### FAA AC 25.1329-1 - Flight Guidance System
- **Scope**: Autopilot, flight director, autothrottle
- **Requirements**: Modes, annunciation, crew awareness

### FAA AC 25.11 - Electronic Flight Deck Displays
- **Topics**: Display design, symbology, colors, readability
- **Integration**: With AC 25.1302-1

### FAA Human Factors Design Standard (HFDS)
- **Applicability**: Military and civil aviation
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive HF design guidance
- **Topics**: Anthropometry, controls, displays, workspace

## Key Principles

### Information Management
- Present information needed for task
- Prioritize by importance and urgency
- Avoid information overload
- Provide situation awareness

### Error Prevention and Tolerance
- Design to prevent errors
- Detect errors when they occur
- Provide recovery from errors
- Minimize consequences of errors

### Consistency and Standardization
- Consistent symbology and terminology
- Standard control actions
- Predictable system behavior
- Industry conventions (ARINC, EUROCAE)

### Workload Management
- Balance workload across phases of flight
- Automate routine tasks
- Provide manual override
- Avoid mode confusion

## Flight Deck Layout

### Primary Flight Display (PFD)
- Attitude, airspeed, altitude, heading
- Flight director guidance
- Autopilot/flight mode annunciation
- Flight path vector, trend vectors

### Navigation Display (ND)
- Lateral navigation (route, waypoints)
- Weather radar, terrain awareness
- Traffic display
- Range selection

### Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS/ECAM)
- Engine parameters
- System synoptics
- Alerting messages (warnings, cautions, advisories)
- Checklists

### Multi-Function Displays (MFD)
- Systems pages
- Flight planning
- Weather information
- Charts and approach plates

## Alerting System Design

### Alert Levels
- **Warning** (Red): Immediate crew action required
- **Caution** (Amber): Timely crew awareness/action required
- **Advisory** (Cyan/White): Crew awareness, no immediate action

### Alert Characteristics
- Visual annunciation (color, flash, text)
- Aural alerts (distinct tones/sounds)
- Priority and inhibit logic
- Master warning/caution lights

### Alert Philosophy
- SAE ARP4754A and ARP4761 drive alert criticality
- DO-178C software ensures alerting logic correctness
- CS-25.1309 defines failure condition classifications

## Control Design

### Flight Controls
- Side stick or yoke
- Rudder pedals
- Throttle levers
- Feedback (force, position, tactile)

### Mode Control Panel (MCP/FCU)
- Autopilot, flight director, autothrottle modes
- Altitude, speed, heading, vertical speed selection
- Clear mode annunciation

### Other Controls
- Landing gear lever (shape-coded, guarded)
- Flap/slat lever
- Speed brake
- Fuel controls

## Display Design

### Visual Design
- Color usage per AC 25.11 (red, amber, green, cyan, white, magenta)
- Font size, legibility at viewing distance
- Contrast ratios for readability
- Anti-aliasing, refresh rate

### Symbology
- Standardized symbols (ARINC, EUROCAE, ISO)
- Intuitive representation
- Clutter management
- Scalability

## Human Factors Verification

### Analysis Methods
- Task analysis
- Workload assessment (e.g., Bedford scale)
- Error analysis (FMEA for crew errors)
- Cognitive walkthrough

### Testing Methods
- Part-task simulation
- Full-flight simulation
- Flight test evaluation
- Pilot-in-the-loop testing

### Evaluation Criteria
- Pilot workload acceptable
- Situation awareness maintained
- Task performance meets standards
- Error rates within bounds

## Key Deliverables

1. **Human Factors Design Plan** - Overall approach and requirements
2. **Flight Deck Layout** - Physical arrangement of controls and displays
3. **Display Format Specification** - Detailed design of each display page
4. **Alerting System Specification** - Alert logic, prioritization, presentation
5. **Task Analysis** - Pilot tasks by phase of flight
6. **Workload Assessment** - Analysis and test results
7. **Human Factors Test Plan and Report** - Verification evidence

## Compliance Requirements

- Flight deck design shall comply with CS-25 / Part 25
- Human factors verification per AC 25.1302-1
- Pilot-in-the-loop evaluation required
- Certification authorities witness key tests

## Integration with Other Standards

- **ARP4754A** - Human factors integrated into systems engineering
- **ARP4761** - Crew error considered in safety assessment
- **DO-178C** - Software implements displays and alerting
- **DO-254** - Hardware for displays and controls

## Common Pitfalls

- Mode confusion (autopilot modes)
- Information overload
- Inconsistent symbology
- Poor alert prioritization
- Inadequate error tolerance

## Tools and Templates

- Display format design tools
- Task analysis templates
- Workload assessment procedures
- Human factors test plans
