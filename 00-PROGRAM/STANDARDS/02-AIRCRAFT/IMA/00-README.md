# IMA

Integrated Modular Avionics standards.

## Overview

This directory contains standards for Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) development and integration, primarily DO-297.

## Applicable Standards

### DO-297 - Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) Development Guidance and Certification Considerations
- **Scope**: IMA systems development, integration, and certification
- **Purpose**: Guidance for partitioned architectures with shared resources

## IMA Concepts

### Architecture
- **Shared Processing Resources**: Multiple applications on common hardware
- **Partitioning**: Spatial and temporal isolation between applications
- **Determinism**: Guaranteed execution timing and resource availability

### Key Components
1. **IMA Platform**: Hardware and operating system providing partitioning
2. **IMA Applications**: Hosted applications (avionics functions)
3. **Core Software**: Real-time operating system (ARINC 653)
4. **Integration Tools**: Configuration, verification, validation

## Partitioning Requirements

### Spatial Partitioning
- Memory protection between partitions
- Prevents one application from accessing another's memory
- Hardware MMU/MPU enforcement

### Temporal Partitioning
- Time-sliced execution
- Fixed partition scheduling
- Guaranteed CPU cycles per partition
- Prevents one partition from starving others

### Resource Partitioning
- I/O channels
- Network bandwidth
- Storage
- Power budget

## Development Process

1. **Platform Definition**: Define IMA architecture, resources, ARINC 653 API
2. **Application Development**: Develop partitioned applications per DO-178C
3. **Integration**: Combine applications on platform per DO-297
4. **Verification**: 
   - Partition isolation testing
   - Interference testing
   - Timing analysis
   - Resource utilization verification

## ARINC 653 Interface

- **Standard API**: APEX (Application Executive)
- **Services**: Partition management, process management, time management, inter-partition communication, health monitoring
- **Configuration**: Static configuration at integration time

## Integration Considerations

### Configuration Management
- Platform configuration data
- Application binaries
- Integration configuration
- Version control of all components

### Verification Challenges
- Partition isolation verification
- Timing analysis complexity
- Interference testing scope
- Resource utilization validation

### Certification Approach
- Platform certified once, reused
- Applications certified per DO-178C
- Integration verified per DO-297
- Incremental certification for new applications

## Key Deliverables

1. **IMA Platform Specification** - Architecture, resources, ARINC 653 implementation
2. **Integration Configuration Data** - Partition definitions, scheduling, resource allocation
3. **Integration Verification Plan** - Test cases for partition isolation, interference
4. **Integration Verification Results** - Test results, analysis
5. **IMA Safety Assessment** - Failure modes, common mode analysis

## Compliance Requirements

- IMA platform development per DO-178C/DO-254
- Application development per DO-178C
- Integration per DO-297
- ARINC 653 API compliance
- Partition isolation demonstration

## Integration with Other Standards

- **ARP4754A** - Systems engineering framework for IMA
- **ARP4761** - Safety assessment including common cause analysis
- **DO-178C** - Software development for platform and applications
- **DO-254** - Hardware design assurance for IMA hardware
- **ARINC 653** - API standard for IMA partitioning
- **ARINC 664** - Network (AFDX) for IMA interconnection

## Common Pitfalls

- Underestimating integration verification effort
- Inadequate timing margin
- Insufficient resource budgeting
- Weak partition isolation
- Configuration management complexity

## Tools and Templates

- See 05-MAPPINGS/ for IMA compliance matrices
- Integration configuration templates
- Verification test procedures
