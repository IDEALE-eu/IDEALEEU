  Systematic tracking of fuel cell stack performance degradation.
  Enables predictive maintenance and optimization of replacement schedules.

steps:
  - step_id: "STEP-01"
    step_name: "Baseline Performance Test"
    description: "Measure current fuel cell performance"
    duration_minutes: 60
    actions:
      - "Warm up fuel cell to operating temperature"
      - "Run standardized load profile"
      - "Measure voltage at multiple current levels"
      - "Record power output vs. current (polarization curve)"
      - "Measure stack temperature distribution"
      - "Record hydrogen consumption rate"
    test_data_recorded:
      - "Polarization curve data"
      - "Peak power output (kW)"
      - "Efficiency at rated power (%)"
      - "Temperature distribution"
      - "H2 consumption rate"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Peak power > 90% of initial rating"
      - "Efficiency > 50% at rated power"

  - step_id: "STEP-02"
    step_name: "Degradation Analysis"
    description: "Compare to historical performance"
    duration_minutes: 30
    actions:
      - "Retrieve historical performance data"
      - "Calculate degradation rate"
      - "Plot performance trend"
      - "Predict remaining useful life"
    test_data_recorded:
      - "Degradation rate (%/1000h)"
      - "Remaining useful life estimate (hours)"
      - "Performance trend (stable/degrading/critical)"
    verification:
      method: "data_analysis"
      sign_off_required: true

  - step_id: "STEP-03"
    step_name: "Maintenance Decision"
    description: "Determine if maintenance action required"
    duration_minutes: 15
    actions:
      - "Evaluate degradation rate against limits"
      - "Determine if stack replacement needed"
      - "Update maintenance schedule if required"
      - "Update UTCS digital passport"
    decision_criteria:
      - if: "Degradation rate > 1.0%/1000h"
        then: "Increase monitoring frequency to 50h"
      - if: "Performance < 85% initial"
        then: "Schedule stack replacement"
      - if: "Performance < 80% initial"
        then: "Ground aircraft, immediate replacement"
