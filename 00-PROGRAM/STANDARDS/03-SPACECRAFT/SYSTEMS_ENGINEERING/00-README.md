Space systems engineering standards.

## Overview

This directory contains standards for space systems engineering based on the ECSS-E-ST-10 series.

## Applicable Standards

### ECSS-E-ST-10C - Space engineering - System engineering general requirements
- **Scope**: End-to-end systems engineering for space missions
- **Key Topics**:
  - Mission analysis and requirements
  - System design and architecture
  - Interface management
  - Verification and validation
  - Configuration and data management

**Lifecycle Phases**:
- Phase 0: Mission Analysis
- Phase A: Feasibility
- Phase B: Preliminary Definition
- Phase C: Detailed Definition
- Phase D: Qualification and Production
- Phase E: Utilization
- Phase F: Disposal

### ECSS-E-ST-10-02C - Verification
- **Verification Methods**: Review, Inspection, Analysis, Test (RIAT)
- **Verification Levels**: Component, Subsystem, System
- **Verification Control Document (VCD)**: Requirements-to-verification traceability

### ECSS-E-ST-10-03C - Testing
- **Test Philosophy**: Protoflight, qualification, acceptance
- **Test Types**: Functional, environmental, performance
- **Test Documentation**: Plans, procedures, reports

### ECSS-E-ST-10-04C - Space Environment
- **Environment Definition**: Vacuum, radiation, thermal, plasma, debris
- **Design Considerations**: Material selection, shielding, thermal control
- **Analysis**: Mission-specific environment modeling

### ECSS-E-ST-10-06C - Technical Requirements Specification
- **TRS Structure**: Functional, performance, interface, operational, constraint requirements
- **Requirements Engineering**: Capture, analysis, allocation, verification

### ECSS-E-ST-10-08C - Functional and Technical Specifications
- **Interface Control Documents (ICD)**: Define interfaces between systems and subsystems
- **Budgets**: Mass, power, data, thermal, pointing budgets

## System Budgets

### Mass Budget
- Dry mass + propellant + margin
- Component-level tracking
- Launch vehicle compatibility

### Power Budget
- Generation (solar arrays, batteries)
- Consumption by mode (launch, eclipse, nominal, safe)
- Margin requirements (typically 20-30%)

### Data Budget
- Downlink capacity vs. data generation
- Onboard storage
- Ground station passes

### Thermal Budget
- Heat generation and dissipation
- Temperature limits per component
- Radiators and heaters sizing

## Interface Management

- **Mechanical Interfaces**: Mounting, alignment, access
- **Electrical Interfaces**: Power, data, signals
- **Thermal Interfaces**: Heat paths, conduction/radiation
- **Data Interfaces**: Protocols, data rates, formats

## Key Deliverables

1. **Mission Requirements Document (MRD)** - Top-level mission objectives and requirements
2. **System Requirements Document (SRD)** - Detailed system requirements
3. **Interface Control Documents (ICDs)** - All system and subsystem interfaces
4. **System Budget Reports** - Mass, power, data, thermal budgets
5. **Verification Control Document (VCD)** - Requirements-to-verification matrix
6. **Design Justification File (DJF)** - Design rationale and trade studies

## Compliance Requirements

- Systems engineering shall follow ECSS-E-ST-10C
- All requirements shall be verifiable (RIAT methods)
- Interfaces formally controlled via ICDs
- Budgets tracked and controlled throughout lifecycle
- Independent reviews at key milestones

## Integration with Other Standards

- **ECSS-E-ST-40C** - Software engineering supports system engineering
- **ECSS-Q-ST-80C** - Software product assurance
- **ECSS-E-ST-31C, -32C** - Mechanical subsystems engineering
- **ECSS-E-ST-20C** - Electrical subsystems engineering

## Tools and Templates

- Mission requirements templates
- ICD templates
- Budget tracking spreadsheets
- VCD templates
