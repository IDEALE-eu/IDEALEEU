## AIT Philosophy

### Protoflight Approach
- **Protoflight Model**: Qualification + Flight model (cost savings)
- **Test Levels**: Acceptance + 25% for protoflight
- **Risk**: Higher than separate qualification model, but mitigated by analysis

### Qualification vs. Acceptance
- **Qualification Model (QM)**: Prove design margins, destructive OK
- **Acceptance Model (FM)**: Verify workmanship, non-destructive
- **Test Levels**: Qualification > Protoflight > Acceptance

## AIT Sequence

6. **Environmental Testing**: Vibration, acoustic, thermal vacuum, EMC
7. **Post-Environmental Functional Test**: Re-verify after environmental stress
8. **Spacecraft-Level Testing**: Mission simulation, payload integration
9. **Pre-Shipment Review**: Verify readiness for transport
10. **Launch Site Operations**: Final integration, fueling, encapsulation

## Test Types
