# 03-SPACECRAFT

Spacecraft standards based on ECSS (European Cooperation for Space Standardization).

## Overview

This directory contains standards applicable to spacecraft development, qualification, and operations. ECSS standards are the primary reference for European space programs and are widely adopted internationally.

## ECSS Standards System

The ECSS system is organized into branches:
- **ECSS-M**: Management (project management, product assurance management)
- **ECSS-E**: Engineering (systems, electrical, mechanical, software, etc.)
- **ECSS-Q**: Product Assurance (quality, safety, reliability, parts, materials)
- **ECSS-S**: Sustainability (space debris mitigation, clean space)

Each standard has a designation like ECSS-X-ST-YY-ZZC:
- **X**: Branch (M, E, Q, S)
- **ST**: Standard (also HB for handbook)
- **YY-ZZ**: Topic number
- **C**: Revision (A, B, C, etc.)

## Key ECSS Standards

- **ECSS-E-ST-10-08C** - Functional and technical specifications

### Software
- **ECSS-E-ST-40C** - Software engineering
- **ECSS-Q-ST-80C** - Software product assurance

### Hardware and Quality
- **ECSS-Q-ST-70C** - Materials, mechanical parts and processes
- **ECSS-Q-ST-60C** - Electrical, electronic and electromechanical (EEE) components
- **ECSS-Q-ST-40C** - Safety

## Product Assurance and Quality

### Criticality Classification
- **Category 1**: Catastrophic (loss of mission, loss of spacecraft)
- **Category 2**: Critical (major mission degradation)
- **Category 3**: Major (minor mission degradation)
- **Category 4**: Minor (no mission impact)

### Software Criticality
- **Category A**: Critical software (failure leads to catastrophic consequences)
- **Category B**: Essential software (failure leads to major degradation)
- **Category C**: Utility software (failure leads to minor degradation)
- **Category D**: Support software (no direct mission impact)

## Mission Assurance Levels

Based on mission criticality and programmatic importance:
- **Level 1**: Critical missions (e.g., flagship science missions, manned missions)
- **Level 2**: Important missions (e.g., Earth observation, navigation)
- **Level 3**: Standard missions (e.g., technology demonstration, university missions)
- **Level 4**: Low-cost missions (e.g., CubeSats, rideshare payloads)

Requirements tailored by level (e.g., redundancy, testing, documentation).

## Space Environment

Key considerations per ECSS-E-ST-10-04C:
- **Vacuum**: Outgassing, cold welding, thermal control
- **Radiation**: Total ionizing dose (TID), single event effects (SEE), displacement damage
- **Temperature**: Extreme temperature swings, thermal cycling
- **Microgravity**: Fluid behavior, structural loads
- **Meteoroids and Debris**: Impact protection
- **Atomic Oxygen**: Material erosion (LEO)
- **Plasma**: Charging and arcing

## Verification and Testing

### Verification Methods (ECSS-E-ST-10-02C)
1. **Review of Design (RD)** - Analysis and review of design documentation
2. **Inspection (I)** - Visual or physical inspection
3. **Analysis (A)** - Mathematical or simulation analysis
4. **Test (T)** - Physical testing

### Test Levels
- **Component Level**: Individual parts and assemblies
- **Subsystem Level**: Integrated subsystems
- **System Level**: Complete spacecraft
- **Acceptance Testing**: Verify flight readiness
- **Qualification Testing**: Prove design margins (typically on engineering model)

### Environmental Testing (ECSS-E-ST-10-03C)
- Mechanical: Vibration, shock, acoustic
- Thermal: Thermal vacuum (TVAC), thermal cycling
- EMC: Conducted and radiated emissions/susceptibility
- Functional: End-to-end system performance

## Assembly, Integration, and Test (AIT)

Typical AIT flow (ECSS-E-ST-10-06C):
1. Component receipt and inspection
2. Subsystem assembly and test
3. System integration
4. System functional tests
5. Environmental qualification/acceptance tests
6. Post-environmental functional tests
7. Pre-shipment review
8. Spacecraft shipping to launch site
9. Launch site operations

## Key Deliverables

2. **Design Justification File (DJF)** - Design rationale and verification
3. **Verification Control Document (VCD)** - Verification requirements matrix
4. **Test Procedures and Reports** - Test plans, procedures, and results
5. **Product Assurance Plans** - Quality, reliability, safety plans
6. **Operations and Maintenance Manuals** - Ground operations, flight operations
