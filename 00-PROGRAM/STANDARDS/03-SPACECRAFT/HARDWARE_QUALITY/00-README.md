### Derating
Component stress reduction to improve reliability:
- Voltage, current, power derating (typically 50-80% of max rating)
- Temperature derating
- Mechanical stress derating

### Screening
- Visual inspection
- X-ray (for internal defects)
- Hermeticity testing (leak test)
- Burn-in (operating at elevated temperature)
- Environmental screening (thermal cycling, vibration)

### Radiation Assurance
- Total Ionizing Dose (TID) tolerance
- Single Event Effects (SEE) susceptibility
- Displacement damage
- Radiation test campaigns
- Latchup protection

## Materials Management

### Material Selection Criteria
- Mechanical properties (strength, stiffness, fatigue)
- Thermal properties (expansion, conductivity, stability)
- Outgassing (vacuum compatibility)
- Flammability (ground safety)
- Corrosion resistance
- Cost and availability

### Material Testing
- Tensile, compression, shear tests
- Fatigue and fracture toughness
- Thermal cycling
- Outgassing (ASTM E595 or equivalent)
- Flammability (NASA-STD-6001 or equivalent)

### Fracture Control
- Damage tolerance analysis
- Proof testing
- Inspection (NDT: X-ray, ultrasound, dye penetrant)
- Fatigue life assessment

## Process Control

### Critical Processes
- Welding (TIG, electron beam, laser)
- Bonding (adhesives, structural bonding)
- Soldering (hand, reflow, wave)
- Coating (anodizing, plating, painting)
- Heat treatment
- Cleaning (precision cleaning, contamination control)

### Process Qualification
- Process specification development
- Operator training and certification
- Process demonstration and approval
- Process monitoring and control
- Non-conformance handling

## Safety Assurance

### Hazard Analysis
- Identify hazards (electrical, mechanical, thermal, chemical, pressure, radiation)
- Assess risk (probability x consequence)
- Mitigate hazards (design, procedures, controls)
- Track hazards through lifecycle

### Safety-Critical Items
- Items whose failure could cause loss of mission or loss of life
- Enhanced quality control and verification
- Redundancy or fail-safe design
- Special handling and traceability

## Reliability Engineering

### Reliability Prediction
- Component-level failure rates (MIL-HDBK-217 or similar)
- System-level reliability modeling
- Mission success probability
- Sensitivity analysis

### FMECA
- Identify failure modes of each component
- Assess effects on higher levels
- Assign criticality
- Define mitigations (redundancy, monitoring, safing)

### Reliability Testing
- Environmental stress screening (ESS)
- Highly accelerated life testing (HALT)
- Reliability demonstration testing
- Accelerated life testing
