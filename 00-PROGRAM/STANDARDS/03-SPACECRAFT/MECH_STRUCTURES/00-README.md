- **Vibration Test**: Sine sweep, random vibration per launch vehicle requirements
- **Acoustic Test**: High-intensity sound field simulating launch
- **Shock Test**: Pyroshock from separation events

### Margins and Factors of Safety
- **Design Limit Load (DLL)**: Maximum expected load
- **Design Ultimate Load (DUL)**: DLL × Factor of Safety (typically 1.25 for metallic, 1.40 for composite)
- **Yield Margin**: (Yield strength / Stress) - 1 ≥ 0
- **Ultimate Margin**: (Ultimate strength / (Stress × FOS)) - 1 ≥ 0

## Mechanisms

### Mechanism Types
- **Deployment Mechanisms**: Solar arrays, antennas, booms
- **Pointing Mechanisms**: Gimbals, scan mechanisms, solar array drive assemblies (SADA)

- **Movable Mechanisms**: Shutters, valves, doors

### Mechanism Requirements
- **Functionality**: Deploy, point, latch, release as required
- **Reliability**: Single-fault tolerance or high demonstrated reliability
- **Life**: Number of cycles (deployments, articulations)
- **Loads**: Withstand launch and operational loads
- **Envelope**: Fit within stowed and deployed configurations

### Lubrication and Tribology

- **Wear and Friction**: Tribology testing and analysis
- **Cold Welding**: Prevention in vacuum environment

### Mechanism Testing
- **Functional Testing**: Verify deployment, motion, latching
- **Life Testing**: Cycles beyond mission requirements
- **Environmental Testing**: Vibration, thermal vacuum
- **Deployment Testing**: In relevant environments (1g, 0g simulation)
