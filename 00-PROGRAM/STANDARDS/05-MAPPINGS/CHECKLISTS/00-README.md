- **Timing**: End of Phase B (preliminary definition)
- **Key Outcomes**: Preliminary design approved, proceed to detailed design
- **Standards Evidence**: Compliance approach defined, preliminary compliance matrices

### CDR (Critical Design Review)
- **Purpose**: Review detailed design, freeze certification basis
- **Timing**: End of Phase C/early Phase D (detailed definition)
- **Key Outcomes**: Design approved, baseline established, proceed to manufacturing/integration
- **Standards Evidence**: Detailed compliance matrices, verification plans, certification plans

### PRR (Production Readiness Review)
- **Purpose**: Verify readiness to start production
- **Timing**: Before production ramp-up
- **Key Outcomes**: Production processes qualified, proceed to serial production
- **Standards Evidence**: Production compliance demonstration, AS9100 certification, Part 21 POA

## Additional Reviews (Not Included Here)

- **SRR** (System Requirements Review): Requirements complete
- **MCR/MDR** (Mission Concept/Definition Review): Spacecraft missions
- **TRR** (Test Readiness Review): Ready to start testing
- **FRR** (Flight Readiness Review): Ready for flight
- **ORR** (Operational Readiness Review): Ready for operations

## Usage

1. Download checklist for upcoming review
2. Assign owners for each item
3. Track progress (complete, in-progress, not-started)
4. Identify open items and action plans
5. Present status to review board
6. Obtain approval to proceed (or identify no-gos)

- **Schedule and Budget**

Each item has:
- **Description**: What is required
- **Owner**: Who is responsible
- **Status**: Complete, In-Progress, Not-Started, N/A
- **Evidence**: Reference to deliverable/artifact
- **Notes**: Additional comments

## Review Board

Typical members:
- Program Manager (chair)
- Chief Engineer
- Systems Engineering Lead
- Domain Leads (software, hardware, structures, etc.)
- Safety Engineer
