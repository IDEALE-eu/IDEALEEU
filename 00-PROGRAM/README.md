## PLUMA — Product Lifecycle UiX Management Automation

**PLUMA** is an industrial-scale automation engine that transforms aerospace product lifecycle management from artisanal processes into replicable, parallelizable, federated operations.

### Key Features
- **9-Phase CAx Model**: CAD, CAE, CAI, CAO, CAM, CAP, CAV, CMP, CAS
- **Parametric Documentation**: 65% context reuse across programs
- **Schema-Driven UI Generation**: <5 minute UI regeneration
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: 50+ concurrent programs by 2027
- **Federation Protocol**: <2 second sync latency across organizations

See **[PLUMA/](./PLUMA/)** for comprehensive architecture and documentation.

## Digital Thread Components

### PLM/PDM with PLUMA
- **CAD** (Computer-Aided Design): Parametric designs scale to N variants
- **CAE** (Computer-Aided Engineering): 10,000+ concurrent simulations
- **CAI** (Computer-Aided Integration): Automated test harness generation
- **CAO** (Computer-Aided Optimization): Quantum backend allocation (64-1024 qubits)
- **CAM** (Computer-Aided Manufacturing): Rate 0→50+/month automation
- **CAP** (Computer-Aided Production): Supply chain orchestration
- **CAV** (Computer-Aided Verification): Fleet-scale V&V
- **CMP** (Compliance Management): Multi-authority certification
- **CAS** (Computer-Aided Services): Global MRO federation

See **[PLUMA/03-CAX_PHASES/](./PLUMA/03-CAX_PHASES/)** for detailed phase documentation.

### MBSE
- SysML modeling, interface control documents, digital twin development  
  See **[DIGITAL_THREAD/04-MBSE/](./DIGITAL_THREAD/04-MBSE/)** and **[DIGITAL_THREAD/05-DIGITAL_TWIN/](./DIGITAL_THREAD/05-DIGITAL_TWIN/)**.

### MES/ERP/QMS
- EBOM↔MBOM management, routings, NCRs, CoC, traceability  
  See **[INDUSTRIALISATION/04-MBOM_ROUTINGS/](./INDUSTRIALISATION/04-MBOM_ROUTINGS/)** and **[QUALITY_QMS/](./QUALITY_QMS/)**.

## Industrialisation
- DFM/DFA, tooling design and qualification, supplier qualification, PPAP/FAI, rate readiness, MRO setup  
  See **[INDUSTRIALISATION/](./INDUSTRIALISATION/)** and **[SUPPLY_CHAIN/06-SUPPLIER_QUALITY/](./SUPPLY_CHAIN/06-SUPPLIER_QUALITY/)**.
