## Definition

**AAMMPP** (Aerospace Assets Management, Maintenance and Procurement Platform) is the end-to-end digital thread for aerospace component quotation, exchange, tracking, and lifecycle governance—from supplier bid to retirement—using UTCS manifests, TFA domains, QS anchoring, and PLUMA automation.

## 🔑 Core Principles

### Evidence-First
Every asset carries a **UTCS digital passport** with immutable provenance.

### QS Anchoring
- **Pre-event superposition (QS)** captures all possible procurement/maintenance outcomes
- **CB (Classical Bit)** crystallizes actual events

### TFA Alignment
All data classified under **15 Topic Functional Areas** (AAA–PPP):
- AAA: Airframes-Aerodynamics-Airworthiness
- AAP: Airport-Adaptable-Platforms
- CCC: Cockpit-Cabin-Cargo
- CQH: Cryogenics-Quantum-H2
- DDD: Drainage-Dehumidification-Drying
- EDI: Electronics-Digital-Instruments
- EEE: Electrical-Endocircular-Energization
- EER: Environmental-Emissions-Remediation
- IIF: Industrial-Infrastructure-Facilities
- IIS: Information-Intelligence-Systems
- LCC: Linkages-Control-Communications
- LIB: Logistics-Inventory-Blockchain
- MMM: Mechanical-Material-Modules
- OOO: Operations-Optimization-Outcomes
- PPP: Propulsion-Power-Plants

### PLUMA Automation
Low-code workflows for RFQ, RMA, MRO, and certification handoffs.

### Quantum Supercomputing Hunting (QSH)
Quantum-optimized sourcing, failure prediction, and logistics routing.

## 🔄 Key Flows (QS → QB)

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **QS** | Capture all potential suppliers, prices, lead times, risk profiles |
| **FWD** | Simulate supply chain disruptions, price volatility, H₂ compatibility |
| **UE** | Atomic asset record: P/N, S/N, certs, geometry, mass |
| **FE** | Federated updates from MROs, airlines, warehouses |
| **CB** | Actual PO issued, asset installed, maintenance performed |
| **QB** | Quantum-optimized resourcing, predictive exchange scheduling |

---

## 🤖 PLUMA Automation Examples

1. **On RFQ creation** → auto-generate UTCS draft + TFA classification
2. **On asset receipt** → validate certs, update UTCS, trigger MRO baseline
3. **On SB issuance** → scan UTCS registry, notify affected operators
4. **On quote expiry** → re-run QSH job for new sourcing options

---

## 🌐 Integration Points

| System | Protocol | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **ERP** (SAP/Oracle) | REST | Sync POs, inventory levels |
| **MRO** (TRAX, AMOS) | EDI/gRPC | Push/pull work orders, asset status |
| **PLM** (Teamcenter) | API | Pull geometry, material specs |
| **Blockchain** | Smart Contract | Immutable audit trail for high-value parts |
| **Quantum Cloud** | Qiskit Runtime | Execute QSH jobs |
