# MAL-EEM Policy

## Ethical AI Principles

### 1. Fairness & Non-Discrimination
- Models must be evaluated for bias across protected attributes
- Regular fairness audits required for production models
- Disparate impact analysis mandatory before deployment

### 2. Transparency & Explainability
- Model decisions must be explainable to stakeholders
- Feature importance and decision rationale documented
- Black-box models require additional scrutiny

### 3. Privacy & Data Protection
- Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and relevant regulations
- Differential privacy where applicable
- Data minimization principles enforced

### 4. Safety & Reliability
- Robust testing under edge cases and adversarial conditions
- Safety gates for high-risk applications
- Continuous monitoring in production

### 5. Accountability & Governance
- Clear ownership of model decisions
- Audit trails for all model versions
- Escalation procedures for ethical concerns

## Review Process

1. **Initial Assessment** - Complete ethical checklist
2. **Technical Review** - Bias testing and fairness metrics
3. **Stakeholder Review** - Impact assessment
4. **CCB Approval** - Final ethical clearance
5. **Continuous Monitoring** - Post-deployment tracking

## Compliance Badges

Models passing ethical review receive MAL-EEM badges:
- **MAL-EEM-Basic** - Standard ethical review passed
- **MAL-EEM-Enhanced** - Advanced fairness validation
- **MAL-EEM-Critical** - High-risk system certification
