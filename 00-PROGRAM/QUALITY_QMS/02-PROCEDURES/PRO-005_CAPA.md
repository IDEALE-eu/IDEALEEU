- Significant single nonconformance
- Audit findings (major/critical)
- Customer complaint
- Adverse trend in metrics
- Risk assessment results
- Near-miss or safety concern

**Initiation:**
1. Complete CAPA form (FORM_CAPA.md)
2. Describe problem/opportunity
3. Assign CAPA owner
4. Set target completion date
5. Submit for approval

### 4.2 Corrective Action Process

**Step 1: Problem Description**
- What happened?
- When and where?
- Scope and severity
- Impact assessment

**Step 2: Containment (Immediate Action)**
- Actions to prevent further occurrences immediately
- Segregate affected product
- Implement temporary controls
- Timeline: Within 24-48 hours

**Step 3: Root Cause Analysis**

**Methods:**
- 5 Whys
- Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)
- Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
- Pareto Analysis
- Process Flow Analysis

**Root Cause Categories:**
- Man (people, training, competence)
- Machine (equipment, tools)
- Material (raw materials, components)
- Method (procedures, processes)
- Measurement (inspection, calibration)
- Environment (conditions, workplace)

**Step 4: Corrective Action Plan**
- Action items to eliminate root cause
- Owner and due date for each action
- Resources required
- Success criteria
- Verification method

**Step 5: Implementation**
- Execute corrective actions per plan
- Update procedures/work instructions if needed
- Provide training if required
- Document completion

**Step 6: Verification of Effectiveness**
- Verify actions implemented
- Confirm root cause eliminated
- Monitor for recurrence (30-90 days minimum)
- Collect objective evidence
- Close CAPA when effective

### 4.3 Preventive Action Process

**Identification of Potential Problems:**
- Analysis of trends
- Lessons learned from other projects
- Industry best practices
- Predictive analysis
- Proactive risk assessment

**Process:**
1. Define potential problem
2. Assess likelihood and impact
3. Identify preventive actions
4. Implement actions
5. Monitor effectiveness

### 4.4 CAPA Prioritization

**Priority Levels:**

- Safety hazard
- Certification risk
- Customer delivery impact
- Multiple customer complaints

**High (1-2 weeks):**
- Significant quality impact
- Process capability concern
- Major audit finding
- Customer dissatisfaction

**Medium (1 month):**
- Minor quality issues
- Efficiency improvements

- In Progress - Under investigation/implementation
- Pending Verification - Actions complete, effectiveness monitoring
- Closed - Verified effective
- Cancelled - Duplicate or not required

**Tracking:**
- CAPA register maintained
- Weekly status review
- Escalation for overdue CAPAs
- Monthly metrics and trending
- Quarterly management review

### 4.7 CAPA Effectiveness Verification

**Verification Methods:**
- Re-audit affected area
- Statistical monitoring
- Review of subsequent NCRs
- Customer feedback
- Process capability study
- Inspection results analysis

**Criteria for Closure:**
- All action items completed
- Effectiveness verified with objective evidence
- No recurrence during monitoring period
- Documentation updated
- Training completed
- Management approval obtained
