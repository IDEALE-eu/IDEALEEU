## 2. Scope

Applies to all nonconformances in:
- Incoming materials and purchased parts
- In-process production
- Final inspection and test
- Supplier-provided products/services
- Internal processes
- Customer returns

## 3. Responsibilities

- **Quality Manager:** NCR system oversight
- **Quality Engineers:** NCR investigation and coordination
- **Material Review Board (MRB):** Disposition decisions
- **Production/Operations:** Identify and segregate nonconformances
- **Engineering:** Technical evaluation and disposition support
- **Suppliers:** Respond to supplier NCRs

## 4. Procedure

### 4.1 Nonconformance Identification

**Sources:**
- Receiving inspection
- In-process inspection
- Final inspection and test
- Internal audits
- Customer complaints
- Supplier notifications
- Process monitoring

### 4.2 NCR Initiation

1. Identify nonconformance
2. Segregate affected material/product (quarantine area, red tag)
3. Complete NCR form (FORM_NCR.md):
   - NCR number (auto-assigned)
   - Date and initiator
   - Description of nonconformance
   - Part/product identification
   - Quantity affected
   - Detection point
4. Attach photos, measurements, test results as evidence
5. Submit to Quality for review

### 4.3 Nonconformance Evaluation

**Quality Engineer:**
1. Verify nonconformance description
2. Assess extent of nonconformance (isolated vs. systemic)
3. Check for similar occurrences
4. Determine severity and customer impact
5. Identify affected lots/batches if applicable
6. Prepare technical evaluation for MRB

### 4.4 Material Review Board (MRB) Disposition

**MRB Composition:**
- Quality Engineer (Chair)
- Engineering representative
- Production/Operations representative
- Customer representative (if required by contract)

**Disposition Options:**

**1. Use As-Is:**
- Product meets functional requirements despite nonconformance
- No safety or certification impact
- Customer approval required if contractual
- Document justification

**2. Rework:**
- Product can be brought into conformance
- Rework instructions prepared by Engineering
- Rework verified by Quality
- Re-inspection after rework

**3. Repair:**
- Product functionality restored but remains non-conforming
- Engineering authorization required
- Customer approval required
- Documented as repair in product history

**4. Return to Supplier:**
- Supplier nonconformance
- Return authorization issued
- Supplier corrective action required

**5. Scrap:**
- Product cannot be made conforming
- No alternative use
- Proper disposal per environmental requirements
- Scrap documented and authorized

**6. Sort/Screen:**
- Suspect population identified
- 100% inspection performed
- Conforming units released
- Nonconforming units per disposition above

### 4.5 Implementation

1. MRB disposition documented on NCR
2. Disposition actions assigned with due dates
3. Rework/repair instructions followed
4. Re-inspection performed and results documented
5. Released product identified (stamp, sticker, traveler)
6. NCR closed when disposition complete

### 4.6 Customer Notification

Notify customer when:
- Contractually required
- Safety or certification impact
- Delivered product affected
- Repair disposition
- Customer-owned tooling/materials affected

**Notification includes:**
- NCR number and description
- Quantity and identification
- Proposed disposition
- Corrective action summary

### 4.7 NCR Closure

**Verification:**
- Disposition implemented correctly
- Required inspections completed
- Documentation complete
- Material released or scrapped
- Corrective action initiated (if required)

**Approval:**
- Quality Engineer verifies closure
- Quality Manager approves closure

### 4.8 Supplier NCRs

**Issuance:**
1. Complete Supplier NCR form
2. Include evidence (photos, measurements)
3. Transmit to supplier within 5 days
4. Request response within 10 days

**Supplier Response:**
- Root cause analysis
- Containment actions
- Corrective action plan
- Preventive action plan
- Timeline for implementation

**Follow-up:**
- Verify corrective action effectiveness
- Update supplier scorecard
- Escalate if inadequate response

## 5. Metrics and Trending

**Tracked Metrics:**
- NCR rate (per 1000 units)
- NCR by type/category
- NCR by source/detection point
- Disposition distribution
- Cost of nonconformance
- Supplier NCR rate

**Analysis:**
- Monthly trending
- Pareto analysis
- Root cause patterns
- Input to CAPA process (PRO-005)
- Management review reporting

## 6. Records

- NCR forms (FORM_NCR.md)
- MRB meeting minutes
- Rework/repair instructions
- Re-inspection records
- Customer notifications
- Supplier responses
- NCR log and metrics

**Retention:** 10 years minimum, life of product for flight-critical items
