# PRO-002: Risk and Opportunity Management

**Procedure Number:** PRO-002  
**Revision:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-01-01  
**Owner:** Quality Manager

## 1. Purpose

Establish a systematic approach to identify, assess, and manage risks and opportunities affecting quality, safety, and business objectives in accordance with AS9100, ISO 9001, and ARP4761.

## 2. Scope

Applies to all organizational activities including design, development, production, supply chain, and support operations for both aircraft and spacecraft programs.

## 3. Responsibilities

- **Risk Manager:** Overall risk management process
- **Quality Manager:** Quality and safety risk oversight
- **Project Managers:** Project-specific risk identification and management
- **Engineering:** Technical risk assessment
- **All Personnel:** Risk and opportunity identification

## 4. Procedure

### 4.1 Risk and Opportunity Identification

**Sources:**
- Strategic planning
- Management review
- Design reviews (SRR, PDR, CDR)
- FMEA/FTA analysis
- Internal audits
- Non-conformances and CAPA
- Lessons learned
- Market analysis

**Methods:**
- Brainstorming sessions
- HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study)
- SWIFT (Structured What-If Technique)
- Checklist analysis
- Expert consultation

### 4.2 Risk Assessment

#### 4.2.1 Risk Categories
- **Technical:** Design, development, verification
- **Safety:** Hazards, failure modes
- **Schedule:** Delays, dependencies
- **Cost:** Budget overruns
- **Supply Chain:** Supplier issues, availability
- **Regulatory:** Certification, compliance
- **Market:** Customer requirements, competition

#### 4.2.2 Risk Rating Matrix

**Probability Scale (P):**
1. Remote (< 10%)
2. Low (10-30%)
3. Medium (30-60%)
4. High (60-90%)
5. Certain (> 90%)

**Impact Scale (I):**
1. Negligible
2. Minor
3. Moderate
4. Major
5. Catastrophic

**Risk Level = P Ã— I**
- Critical: 15-25
- High: 9-14
- Medium: 4-8
- Low: 1-3

### 4.3 Risk Mitigation

**Strategies:**
- **Avoid:** Eliminate the risk source
- **Reduce:** Implement controls to reduce probability/impact
- **Transfer:** Share risk with partners, insurance
- **Accept:** Accept residual risk with contingency plan

**Mitigation Plans Include:**
- Risk description and rating
- Mitigation actions
- Owner and due date
- Resources required
- Success criteria

### 4.4 Opportunity Management

**Types:**
- Process improvements
- Cost reduction
- Technology advancement
- Market expansion
- Capability enhancement

**Evaluation:**
- Benefit assessment
- Feasibility analysis
- Resource requirements
- Implementation planning

### 4.5 Risk Monitoring and Review

- Risk register reviewed quarterly minimum
- Critical risks reviewed monthly
- Status updates at management review
- Re-assessment after significant events or changes
- Closeout when mitigated or no longer applicable

### 4.6 Safety Assessment (ARP4761)

#### 4.6.1 Methods
- **FTA (Fault Tree Analysis):** Top-down analysis of failure conditions
- **FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis):** Bottom-up analysis
- **CMA (Common Mode Analysis):** Identify common cause failures
- **ZSA (Zonal Safety Analysis):** Zone-specific hazard identification

#### 4.6.2 Safety Risk Classification
Per ARP4754A/ARP4761:
- **Catastrophic:** Prevents continued safe flight/landing
- **Hazardous:** Large reduction in safety margin
- **Major:** Significant reduction in safety margin
- **Minor:** Slight reduction in safety margin
- **No Safety Effect:** No effect on safety

#### 4.6.3 Development Assurance Levels (DAL)
- **DAL A:** Catastrophic
- **DAL B:** Hazardous  
- **DAL C:** Major
- **DAL D:** Minor
- **DAL E:** No Safety Effect

### 4.7 ECSS Risk Management

For spacecraft projects, risk management per ECSS-M-ST-80C:
- Risk identification workshops
- Risk assessment using ECSS risk matrix
- Risk mitigation and tracking
- Risk acceptance by program management

## 5. Records

- Risk Register (LOG_RISK_REGISTER.csv)
- Risk assessment forms
- FTA/FMEA/CMA documentation
- Mitigation plans and status reports
- Management review records

## 6. Related Documents

- ARP4761 (Safety Assessment)
- ECSS-M-ST-80C (Risk Management)
- PRO-007_MANAGEMENT_REVIEW
- Section 13-RISK_SAFETY/
