# STATEMENTS_OF_COMPLIANCE (SoC)

Formal compliance declarations submitted to certification authorities.

## Purpose

Statements of Compliance provide formal declarations that:
- Requirements have been satisfied
- Tests have been completed successfully
- Analyses have been performed and documented
- Processes have been followed
- Tools have been qualified

Each SoC is a legally binding statement signed by authorized personnel.

## Statement Types

Declares that:
- All applicable requirements have been identified
- Requirements are traced to verification activities
- All requirements have been verified
- Verification evidence is documented and available

### Test Compliance Statement
**File**: `TEST_COMPLIANCE_STATEMENT.md`

Declares that:
- Test plans have been followed
- All required tests have been executed
- Test results demonstrate requirement satisfaction
- Test evidence is documented and traceable
- Non-conformances have been resolved

### Analysis Compliance Statement
**File**: `ANALYSIS_COMPLIANCE_STATEMENT.md`

Declares that:
- Required analyses have been performed
- Analysis methods are appropriate and validated
- Analysis results support compliance claims
- Analysis documentation is complete
- Assumptions and limitations are documented

### Process Compliance Statement
**File**: `PROCESS_COMPLIANCE_STATEMENT.md`

Declares that:
- Approved processes have been followed
- Process deviations have been documented and approved
- Process audits have been completed
- Process records are complete and available
- Quality assurance oversight has been maintained

### Tool Qualification Statement
**File**: `TOOL_QUALIFICATION_STATEMENT.md`

Declares that:
- Tools used in certification have been identified
- Tool qualification requirements have been assessed
- Required tool qualifications have been completed
- Tool qualification data is documented
- Tool usage is controlled and monitored

## SoC Development Process

### Phase 1: Preparation (Phase D)
- Identify SoC requirements based on certification plans
- Assign responsibility for each SoC
- Draft preliminary SoC based on compliance checklist status
- Identify evidence gaps

### Phase 2: Evidence Collection (Phase D-E)
- Complete all verification activities
- Collect and organize evidence
- Update compliance checklists
- Prepare evidence packages

### Phase 3: Review (Phase E)
- Internal technical review
- Quality assurance review
- Management review
- Legal review (if required)
- Update based on review comments

### Phase 4: Approval (Phase E)
- Signature by authorized personnel:
  - Technical lead (engineering compliance)
  - Quality Manager (process compliance)
  - Certification Manager (overall compliance)
  - Program Manager (final approval)

### Phase 5: Submittal (Phase E-F)
- Submit to certification authority
- Track authority review
- Address any findings or questions
- Obtain authority acceptance

## SoC Format

Each Statement of Compliance includes:

### 1. Header
- Document identifier
- Revision and date
- Product/system identification
- Applicable certification basis

### 2. Declaration
- Clear statement of compliance
- Scope of compliance
- Standards/regulations addressed
- Conditions or limitations

### 3. Basis for Compliance
- Summary of compliance approach
- Compliance methods used
- Key verification activities
- Evidence summary

### 4. Evidence References
- Detailed evidence list
- Document references
- Test report references
- Analysis report references
- Review records

### 5. Deviations and Waivers
- Any approved deviations
- Rationale for deviations
- Impact assessment
- Compensating measures

### 6. Signatures
- Name, title, date
- Technical authority
- Quality authority
- Certification authority
- Program authority

## Quality Requirements

- All SoCs undergo peer review before approval
- Evidence must be complete and accessible
- Traceability must be demonstrable
- Configuration control must be maintained
- All findings must be closed before signature

## Authority Review

After submittal:
1. Authority preliminary review (2-4 weeks)
2. Questions and clarifications (as needed)
3. Authority detailed review (4-8 weeks)
4. Findings issued (if any)
5. Finding closure and re-submittal
6. Authority acceptance

Track authority review in:
- [`../AUTHORITY_CORRESPONDENCE/QUESTIONS_AND_RESPONSES/`](../AUTHORITY_CORRESPONDENCE/QUESTIONS_AND_RESPONSES/)
- [`../AUTHORITY_CORRESPONDENCE/FINDING_REPORTS/`](../AUTHORITY_CORRESPONDENCE/FINDING_REPORTS/)

## Configuration Management

SoCs are baselined at:
- Initial submittal to authority
- Each revision based on findings
- Final accepted version

Configuration control per:
- [`../../CONFIG_MGMT/05-BASELINES/`](../../CONFIG_MGMT/05-BASELINES/)
