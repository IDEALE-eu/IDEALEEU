## Integration with Program

Certification packages align with program phase gates:
- Phase B Gate: PDR_COMPLIANCE package approval required
- Phase C Gate: CDR_COMPLIANCE package approval required
- Phase D Gate: TRR_COMPLIANCE package approval required
- Phase E Gate: PRR_COMPLIANCE package approval required
- Phase F Gate: FINAL_CERT package and certificate issuance required

No phase gate can be passed without certification package approval.
