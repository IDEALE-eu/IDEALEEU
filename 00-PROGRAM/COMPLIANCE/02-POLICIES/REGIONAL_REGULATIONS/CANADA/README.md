# Canada Regulatory Framework

## Overview

Canada's privacy framework is based on the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), with proposed AI-specific legislation (AIDA) as part of Bill C-27. Provincial privacy laws apply in certain provinces.

- Similar to PIPEDA but Alberta-specific

### Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA) - Proposed
**Status**: Bill C-27, in legislative process

**Scope**:
- AI systems that may cause harm or biased output
- Design, development, making available of high-impact AI systems
- Risk-based approach

**Key Provisions**:

#### 1. Obligations for High-Impact AI Systems
- **Impact Assessment**: Before making available, conduct assessment of risk of harm or biased output
- **Mitigation Measures**: Establish measures to identify, assess, mitigate risks
- **Monitoring**: Ongoing monitoring for material harms
- **Record-Keeping**: Maintain records of compliance activities
- **Transparency**: Publish plain-language description of system

#### 2. Prohibited Conduct
- Knowingly making available AI system likely to cause serious harm
- Possessing or using anonymized data with intent to re-identify

- Compliance orders

#### 4. Penalties
- Administrative monetary penalties
- Violation of duties: up to CAD $10 million or 3% of gross global revenue

**Definitions**:
- **AI System**: Technological system that, autonomously or partly autonomously, processes data related to human activities through use of genetic algorithm, neural network, machine learning, or other technique to generate content or make decisions, recommendations, or predictions
- **High-Impact System**: AI system that may cause harm or biased output
- **Harm**: Physical or psychological harm, property damage, economic loss
