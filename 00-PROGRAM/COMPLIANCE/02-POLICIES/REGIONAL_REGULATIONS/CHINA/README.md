- Language barriers for original texts

### Data Sovereignty
- Data localization requirements may conflict with global data strategies
- Cross-border transfer restrictions limit data accessibility
- Important data classification remains ambiguous

### Enforcement Uncertainty
- Relatively new regulations, enforcement practices evolving
- Variation in local enforcement
- Sanctions can be severe (business operations impact)

### Technology and Operational Impact
- Infrastructure requirements for data localization
- Latency and performance implications
- Compliance cost and complexity
- Integration with global compliance program
