# United States Regulatory Framework

## Overview

The United States employs a sector-specific and framework-based approach to data protection and AI regulation, rather than comprehensive federal legislation. Compliance requires understanding multiple federal agencies, sector-specific regulations, and increasingly important state privacy laws.

## Key Regulatory Frameworks

### NIST Privacy Framework
- Voluntary framework for managing privacy risks
- Aligns with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Core functions: Identify, Govern, Control, Communicate, Protect
- See: [`NIST_Privacy_Framework.md`](NIST_Privacy_Framework.md)

### NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- Voluntary framework for trustworthy AI development
- Core functions: Govern, Map, Measure, Manage
- Cross-sectoral applicability
- See: [`NIST_AI_RMF.md`](NIST_AI_RMF.md)

### State Privacy Laws
- California CCPA/CPRA
- Virginia CDPA
- Colorado CPA
- Connecticut CTDPA
- Utah UCPA
- And growing list of state laws
- See: [`State_Privacy_Laws.md`](State_Privacy_Laws.md)

### Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
- Consumer protection authority
- Unfair and deceptive practices
- Data security expectations
- AI-specific guidance

### Sector-Specific Regulations
- **Aviation**: FAA regulations (14 CFR)
- **Space**: NASA requirements, FAA/AST commercial space
- **Defense**: DoD cybersecurity requirements (CMMC, NIST 800-171)
- **Export Control**: ITAR, EAR
- See: [`FAA_Regulations.md`](FAA_Regulations.md), [`Export_Control.md`](Export_Control.md)

## Aviation Industry Compliance

### Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
- 14 CFR Part 21: Certification procedures
- 14 CFR Part 25: Airworthiness standards
- 14 CFR Part 121: Air carrier operating requirements
- Advisory Circulars (ACs) for guidance

### DO-178C / DO-254
- Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification
- Design Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic Hardware
- Industry standard referenced by FAA

### Cybersecurity
- AI-48: Cybersecurity Operational Resilience
- DO-326A/ED-202A: Airworthiness Security Process Specification
- DO-355/ED-203: Information Security Guidance

## Space Industry Compliance

### Commercial Space Transportation
- FAA/AST licensing and regulations
- 14 CFR Part 400-499: Commercial space regulations
- Safety approval process
- Payload review

### NASA Requirements
- NPR 7150.2: NASA Software Engineering Requirements
- NPR 8705.2: Human-Rating Requirements for Space Systems
- NASA-STD-8719.13: Software Safety Standard
- Mission assurance requirements

### Export Control for Space
- ITAR Category XV: Spacecraft and related articles
- EAR controls for certain commercial satellites
- OFAC sanctions compliance

## Defense Industry Compliance

### Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)
- Levels 1-3 certification requirements
- NIST 800-171 controls baseline
- Required for DoD contractors
- Includes AI system security

### NIST 800-171
- Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
- 110 security requirements
- Self-assessment and certification

### International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)
- Defense articles and services
- Strict export and transfer controls
- Registration and licensing requirements
- Person-to-person transfer restrictions

## Applicability to IDEALEEU.EU

### Data Protection
- Applicable if processing US residents' data
- State law compliance (especially California)
- FTC expectations for data security
- Voluntary adherence to NIST Privacy Framework

### AI Systems
- Voluntary adoption of NIST AI RMF
- Sector-specific regulatory expectations (FAA, NASA)
- Ethical AI commitments
- Transparency and fairness practices

### Aviation Operations
- FAA certification if operating in US airspace
- Compliance with safety and security standards
- PNR data considerations if US flights
- Export control for technology and technical data

### Space Missions
- FAA/AST licensing if launching from US
- NASA requirements if government partnerships
- Export control for US-origin components
- ITAR compliance for defense-related space systems

### Defense Contracts
- CMMC certification if DoD contractor
- NIST 800-171 implementation
- ITAR registration and compliance
- Supply chain security requirements

## Compliance Strategy

### Risk-Based Approach
1. Identify applicable regulations based on:
   - Geographic presence (offices, operations)
   - Customer/user location (especially California)
   - Sector-specific activities (aviation, space, defense)
   - Business relationships (government contracts)

2. Prioritize based on:
   - Regulatory enforcement trends
   - Business criticality
   - Risk of non-compliance
   - Resource availability

3. Implement controls:
   - Privacy by design
   - AI governance framework
   - Cybersecurity baseline (NIST frameworks)
   - Training and awareness

### Monitoring and Adaptation
- Track regulatory developments at federal and state levels
- Participate in industry working groups
- Engage with regulatory agencies
- Update policies and procedures regularly
- Continuous compliance assessment
