# GDPR Compliance Framework

## Overview

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - Regulation (EU) 2016/679 - is the primary data protection framework for the European Union, establishing comprehensive requirements for processing personal data of individuals in the EU.

## Scope

### Territorial Scope (Art. 3)
- **Establishment**: Applies to processing by controllers/processors established in the EU
- **Targeting**: Applies to processing of EU residents' data when offering goods/services or monitoring behavior
- **Representative**: Non-EU controllers/processors must appoint an EU representative

### Material Scope
- **Personal Data**: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
- **Processing**: Any operation performed on personal data (collection, storage, use, disclosure, deletion)
- **Exemptions**: Purely personal/household activities, law enforcement (covered by separate directive)

## Key Principles (Art. 5)

### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency
- **Lawful Basis Required**: At least one of six legal bases (consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task, legitimate interests)
- **Fair Processing**: No misleading or deceptive practices
- **Transparency**: Clear, plain language privacy notices

### 2. Purpose Limitation
- Specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes at collection
- No further processing incompatible with original purposes
- Compatible uses: archiving, research, statistics (with safeguards)

### 3. Data Minimization
- Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary
- Avoid collecting "nice to have" data
- Regular data audits to identify unnecessary data

### 4. Accuracy
- Every reasonable step to ensure accuracy
- Prompt rectification or erasure of inaccurate data
- Regular review and update processes

### 5. Storage Limitation
- Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes
- Retention schedules established per processing activity
- Longer retention permitted for archiving, research (with safeguards)

### 6. Integrity and Confidentiality
