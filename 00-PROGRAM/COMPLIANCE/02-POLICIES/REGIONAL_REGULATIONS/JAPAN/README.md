# Japan Regulatory Framework

## Overview

Japan's regulatory approach emphasizes a balance between privacy protection and business innovation, with the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) as the primary data protection law and a principles-based approach to AI governance.

- Cannot be restored to identify individuals
- Specific processing and handling requirements

## Japan vs. GDPR Comparison

| Aspect | Japan APPI | EU GDPR |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Consent** | Opt-out generally sufficient | Opt-in required |
| **DPO** | Not required | Required in certain cases |
| **DPIA** | Not required | Required for high-risk |
| **Breach Notification** | To PPC if significant | To authority 72hrs, subjects if high risk |
| **Fines** | Criminal penalties, relatively low | Up to â‚¬20M or 4% turnover |
| **Scope** | Personal information databases | All personal data processing |
| **Individual Rights** | Disclosure, correction, suspension | Broader set including portability |
| **Cross-Border** | Consent required (with exceptions) | Adequacy/safeguards required |

**Adequacy**: Japan has adequacy decision from EU (mutual recognition with Supplementary Rules)

## Key Differences from Other Jurisdictions

### Opt-Out vs. Opt-In
- Japan allows opt-out for most third-party provisions
- Contrasts with GDPR's opt-in requirement
- Except for sensitive personal information

### Focus on Purpose
- Purpose specification central to APPI
- Less emphasis on legal basis types compared to GDPR
- Purpose change requires assessment

### Practical Enforcement
- More guidance and consultation approach
- Criminal penalties less frequently applied
- Focus on improvement and compliance

### Innovation-Friendly
