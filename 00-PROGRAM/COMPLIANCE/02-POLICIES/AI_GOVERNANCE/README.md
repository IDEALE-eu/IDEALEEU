# AI Governance Framework

## Overview

This directory contains policies and procedures for responsible AI development, deployment, and management across the IDEALEEU.EU program, ensuring compliance with the EU AI Act and other applicable regulations while promoting ethical and trustworthy AI.

## Core Policies

### AI Ethics Policy ([`AI_Ethics_Policy.md`](AI_Ethics_Policy.md))
- Foundational principles for ethical AI
- Human rights and fundamental freedoms protection
- Transparency and accountability commitments
- Stakeholder engagement and consultation

### Risk Classification ([`Risk_Classification.md`](Risk_Classification.md))
- EU AI Act risk classification methodology
- Prohibited, high-risk, limited-risk, minimal-risk AI
- Classification workflow and approval process
- Ongoing risk reassessment procedures

### Model Governance ([`Model_Governance.md`](Model_Governance.md))
- AI model lifecycle management
- Model versioning and change control
- Model documentation requirements (Model Cards)
- Model validation and testing
- Model retirement and decommissioning

### Bias Mitigation ([`Bias_Mitigation.md`](Bias_Mitigation.md))
- Bias identification and assessment
- Fairness metrics and evaluation
- Data bias mitigation strategies
- Algorithmic bias mitigation techniques
- Ongoing monitoring and correction

### Human Oversight ([`Human_Oversight.md`](Human_Oversight.md))
- Human oversight requirements per risk level
- Human-in-the-loop vs. human-on-the-loop
- Stop button and intervention mechanisms
- Competence and training requirements
- Automation bias awareness

### Transparency Requirements ([`Transparency_Requirements.md`](Transparency_Requirements.md))
- Explainability and interpretability standards
- User notification requirements
- AI-generated content labeling
- Transparency in decision-making
- Documentation and audit trails

## Risk-Based Approach

### Prohibited AI Systems
**Not Permitted**:
- Subliminal manipulation
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities
- Social scoring by public authorities
- Certain biometric uses
- Real-time remote biometric identification (with narrow exceptions)

**Enforcement**: Immediate prohibition, escalation to legal

### High-Risk AI Systems
**Requirements**:
- Risk management system
- Data governance and quality
- Technical documentation (Annex IV)
- Record-keeping and logging
- Transparency and information provision
- Human oversight
- Accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity
- Quality management system
- Conformity assessment
- CE marking and registration

**Examples in IDEALEEU.EU**:
- Automated flight planning and operations
- Predictive maintenance (safety-critical)
- Crew assessment and training systems
- Employment and HR AI systems
- Passenger biometric identification
- Spacecraft autonomous navigation (crew safety)

### Limited-Risk AI Systems
**Requirements**:
- Transparency obligations (user notification)
- AI-generated content labeling
- Deepfake disclosure

**Examples**:
- Customer service chatbots
- Marketing content generation
- Non-safety-critical recommendations

### Minimal-Risk AI Systems
**Requirements**:
- Good practices and ethical considerations
- Voluntary codes of conduct

**Examples**:
- Spam filters
- Inventory optimization
- Non-critical data analysis

## AI Governance Structure

### AI Ethics Board
- **Composition**: Cross-functional representation (technical, legal, operations, ethics)
- **Frequency**: Quarterly meetings, ad-hoc for urgent matters
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Review and approve AI system classifications
  - Oversee high-risk AI compliance
  - Approve AI ethics policies
  - Incident review and lessons learned
  - Guidance on ethical dilemmas

### AI Compliance Officer
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Maintain AI inventory
  - Coordinate AI Act compliance
  - Support risk classifications
  - Monitor regulatory developments
  - Training and awareness
  - Authority liaison

### AI Development Teams
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Implement AI governance policies
  - Document AI systems (Model Cards, technical documentation)
  - Conduct risk assessments
  - Implement bias mitigation
  - Maintain audit trails
  - Report incidents
