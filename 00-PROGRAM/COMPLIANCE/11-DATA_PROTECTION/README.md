- High risk to rights and freedoms

DPIA includes:
- Description of processing operations
- Necessity and proportionality assessment
- Risk assessment (likelihood and severity)

- Data subject consultation (if appropriate)

DPIAs stored in `DPIA/` directory by project/system.

### Privacy Notices

Inform data subjects per GDPR Art. 13-14:
- Controller identity and contact
- DPO contact details
- Purposes and legal basis
- Recipients of data
- Retention period

- Right to complain to supervisory authority

Privacy notices for:
- Employees (recruitment, employment)
- Customers (sales, support)
- Website visitors (cookies, analytics)
- Suppliers/partners

### Data Processing Agreements (DPA)

GDPR Art. 28 requires written contracts with processors:
- Subject matter and duration
- Nature and purpose of processing
- Type of personal data
- Categories of data subjects

- **Notification to Supervisory Authority**: Within 72 hours of becoming aware (if risk to rights and freedoms)
- **Communication to Data Subjects**: Without undue delay (if high risk)

Breach register includes:
- Facts of breach (what, when, how many affected)
- Consequences and potential consequences
- Measures taken or proposed

Breach response process:
1. Detect and contain
2. Assess scope and severity
3. Notify DPO immediately
4. Investigate and document
5. Notify supervisory authority (if required)
6. Notify data subjects (if required)
7. Implement corrective actions
8. Review and learn

## Data Protection Officer (DPO)

### Role and Responsibilities
- Monitor GDPR compliance
- Advise on data protection obligations
- Conduct DPIAs
- Cooperate with supervisory authority
- Act as contact point for data subjects and authority

### Independence
- Reports to highest management level
- No conflicts of interest
- Cannot be dismissed for performing DPO duties

### Contact
DPO contact details published:
- Internal: Intranet, policies, training
- External: Website, privacy notices, contracts

## Data Security Measures

GDPR Art. 32 requires appropriate technical and organizational measures:

### Technical Measures
- Encryption (data at rest and in transit)
- Pseudonymization where possible
- Access controls (authentication, authorization)
- Network security (firewalls, segmentation)
- Backup and recovery
- Security testing and monitoring

### Organizational Measures

- Vendor management (DPAs, audits)
- Incident response plan
- Regular audits and reviews

## International Data Transfers

GDPR Ch. V governs transfers outside EU/EEA:

### Transfer Mechanisms
- **Adequacy Decisions**: EU Commission deems country adequate (e.g., UK, Switzerland, Japan)
- **Standard Contractual Clauses** (SCC): EU-approved contract templates
- **Binding Corporate Rules** (BCR): Internal policies for multinationals
- **Certifications**: Privacy Shield (invalidated), successor frameworks
- **Derogations**: Consent, contract necessity, legal claims

### Transfer Risk Assessment
Per Schrems II ruling:
- Assess laws of destination country

- Implement supplementary measures if needed
- Document assessment

## Aviation-Specific Considerations

### PNR Data (Passenger Name Records)
If processing passenger data:

- Purpose limitation
- Retention limits (5 years)
- Security requirements

### Crew Data
- Licensing and qualification records
- Flight time and duty time records
- Medical certificates
- Security background checks

Balance between:
- Safety requirements (retention for investigations)
- Data minimization (GDPR)

### Flight Data Monitoring
De-identify flight data recorder (FDR) analysis:
- Remove pilot identifiers where possible
- Aggregate for trend analysis
- Restrict access to safety purposes only

## Space Mission Considerations

### Telemetry and Operations Data
- Minimize personal data in telemetry
- Limit crew monitoring to necessary safety/health data
- Clear purpose for psychological support data

### International Crews
- Multi-national crews = multiple jurisdictions
