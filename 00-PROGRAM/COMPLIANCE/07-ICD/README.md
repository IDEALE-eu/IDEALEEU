# 07-ICD

Interface Control Documents (ICDs) relevant to compliance, certification, and regulatory interfaces.

## Purpose

Manage interface definitions and control documents that have compliance implications, ensuring proper coordination between systems, organizations, and regulatory bodies.

## Contents

### System Interface ICDs with Compliance Impact

Interfaces that affect certification or compliance:
- **Avionics Integration Interfaces** (DO-178C/DO-254 compliance)
- **Propulsion System Interfaces** (emission compliance, noise limits)
- **Human-Machine Interface** (HMI) (certification requirements)
- **Ground Support Equipment** (GSE) interfaces
- **Data Link Interfaces** (cybersecurity compliance DO-326A)

### Organizational ICDs

- **Certification Authority Interface** (EASA, FAA, ESA)
  - Data submission formats
  - Reporting requirements
  - Inspection access protocols
  - Change notification procedures

- **Customer Interface**
  - Compliance reporting
  - Certification status updates
  - Regulatory change notifications
  - Certificate transfer procedures

- **Supplier Interface**
  - Compliance data requirements
  - Certificate of Conformity (CoC) formats
  - Material certification requirements
  - Traceability requirements

### Regulatory Data Interfaces

- **Type Certificate Data Sheet** (TCDS) interface
- **Instructions for Continued Airworthiness** (ICA) format
- **Compliance Documentation** submission format
- **Continued Operational Safety** (CoS) reporting
- **Service Difficulty Reports** (SDR) format

### Inter-Program ICDs

When IDEALEEU.EU interfaces with other programs:
- Shared component certification approach
- Common equipment qualification data
- Standardized test procedures
- Shared facility usage agreements

## ICD Structure

Each ICD document includes:
- **Interface Description**: What is being interfaced
- **Interface Requirements**: Functional and performance requirements
- **Compliance Requirements**: Applicable standards and regulations
- **Data Exchange Formats**: Protocols, schemas, file formats
- **Verification Method**: How interface compliance is verified
- **Responsible Parties**: Who owns each side of interface
- **Change Control**: How interface changes are managed

## Compliance-Critical Interfaces

### DO-178C/DO-254 Interfaces
Software and hardware interfaces requiring:
- Interface Control Document (ICD) per ARP4754A
- Interface Requirements Specification
- Interface testing per DO-178C Table A-5
- Configuration control per DO-178C section 7

### Safety-Critical Interfaces
Interfaces affecting safety per ARP4761:
- Fault propagation analysis
- Common mode failure analysis
- Interface failure effects
- Safety monitoring requirements

### Cybersecurity Interfaces
External data connections requiring DO-326A:
- Threat surface analysis
- Security architecture
- Data encryption requirements
- Access control mechanisms

## ICD Lifecycle

1. **Identification**: Interface need identified
2. **Definition**: Requirements and design defined
3. **Agreement**: Both parties sign ICD
4. **Baseline**: ICD placed under configuration control
5. **Verification**: Interface tested and verified
6. **Certification**: Authority approval if needed
7. **Maintenance**: Changes managed through CCB

## Configuration Control

All ICDs are controlled documents:
- Version control in PDM/PLM system
- Change requests via Engineering Change (EC) process
- Both parties must approve changes
- Impact assessment on compliance/certification
- Authority notification if TC/STC affected

## Key Artifacts

### ICD_REGISTER.csv
Master list of compliance-relevant ICDs:
- ICD Number, Title, Version
- Systems/Organizations interfaced
- Compliance Standards Applicable
- Certification Impact (Yes/No)
- Owner, Status, Baseline Date

### AUTHORITY_INTERFACE_MATRIX.xlsx
Maps certification authority requirements to:
- Data submission deadlines
- Format requirements
- Approval workflows
- Point of contact

### SUPPLIER_COMPLIANCE_ICD/
Standard interface for supplier compliance data:
- Certificate of Conformity (CoC) template
- Material certification data requirements
- Test data submission format
- Traceability documentation requirements

### CERTIFICATION_DATA_SCHEMA/
XML/JSON schemas for:
- Compliance matrix data exchange
- Test results submission
- Evidence index format
- CAPA status reporting

## Interface Verification

Compliance interfaces verified through:
- **Interface Testing**: Functional testing at interface boundary
- **Data Exchange Validation**: Verify formats and protocols
- **Process Audit**: Verify procedural interfaces working
- **Documentation Review**: Verify ICD requirements met

## Traceability

ICDs trace to:
- **System Requirements**: Interface requirements flow from system requirements
- **Compliance Matrix**: ICD requirements tracked in compliance matrix
- **Test Plans**: Interface tests defined in V&V plans
- **Evidence**: Interface verification evidence indexed

## Integration Points

- **System Architecture**: [`../../SYSTEMS_ENGINEERING/ARCHITECTURE/`](../../SYSTEMS_ENGINEERING/ARCHITECTURE/)
- **Requirements**: [`../../REQUIREMENTS/`](../../REQUIREMENTS/)
- **Compliance Matrix**: [`../05-REGISTERS/COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.csv`](../05-REGISTERS/COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.csv)
- **V&V Plans**: [`../../CONFIG_MGMT/08-VERIFICATION_VALIDATION/`](../../CONFIG_MGMT/08-VERIFICATION_VALIDATION/)
- **Configuration Management**: [`../../CONFIG_MGMT/`](../../CONFIG_MGMT/)

## Authority Interface Management

### EASA Interface
- Certification Management Specification (CMS)
- Certification Program (CP)
- Certification Review Items (CRI) list
- Type Certificate Application submission

### FAA Interface
- Certification Plan (CP)
- Certification Project Notification (CPN)
- Issue Papers (IP)
- Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS)

### Supplier Interface
- Supplier Quality Requirements (SQR)
- Purchase Order (PO) compliance requirements
- First Article Inspection (FAI) data format
- Production Part Approval Process (PPAP)

## Change Impact Assessment

When interfaces change, assess impact on:
- System requirements and design
- Compliance evidence
- Certification basis
- Test plans and procedures
- Supplier agreements
- Authority approvals
