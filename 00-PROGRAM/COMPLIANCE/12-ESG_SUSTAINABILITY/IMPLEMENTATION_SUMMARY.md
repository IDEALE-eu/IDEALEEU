    recyclability_pct: {percentage}
    material_efficiency_pct: {percentage}
  social:
    fair_labor_certified: {boolean}
    supply_chain_transparency_score: {score}
  governance:
    audit_status: {compliant|non_compliant}
    certifications: [ISO 14001, SA 8000, GRI]
  transformation_value:
    cost_reduction_pct: {percentage}
    emissions_avoided_kg: {value}
    resource_efficiency_gain_pct: {percentage}
```

### QS/CB Anchoring for ESG Data
