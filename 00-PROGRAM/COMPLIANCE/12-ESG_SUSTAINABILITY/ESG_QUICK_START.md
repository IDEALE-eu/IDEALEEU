# ESG Quick Start Guide

## Welcome to IDEALE-EU ESG Compliance

This quick start guide will help you integrate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations into your aerospace projects and adopt Green Performant Tools (GPTs).

## Why ESG Matters

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet evolving EU and international ESG regulations
- **Market Access**: Satisfy green procurement requirements and ESG-conscious customers
- **Cost Savings**: Reduce waste, energy, and material costs through efficiency
- **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid environmental liabilities and reputational risks
- **Competitive Advantage**: Differentiate through sustainability leadership
- **Transformation Value**: Create measurable economic, environmental, social, and innovation value

## ESG Framework Overview

We provide our EU with ESG compliant Green Performant Tools (GPT) with key indications that qualify them through Produced Transformation value.

### Three Pillars

1. **Environmental (E)**: Climate action, resource efficiency, circular economy
2. **Social (S)**: Labor standards, diversity, community engagement, supply chain ethics
3. **Governance (G)**: Transparency, ethics, compliance, risk management

### Produced Transformation Value

Quantifiable benefits across four dimensions:
- **Economic**: Cost savings, revenue growth, ROI
- **Environmental**: Emissions reduced, resources conserved
- **Social**: Jobs created, skills developed, communities benefited
- **Innovation**: Patents, competitive advantage, strategic options

## Step 3: Integrate ESG into Digital Passports

Every IDEALE-EU digital passport includes ESG metadata.

### ESG Passport Fields

    recyclability_pct: 85
    material_efficiency_pct: 28
    energy_consumption_kwh: 450
    water_usage_liters: 1200
  social:
    fair_labor_certified: true
    supply_chain_transparency_score: 92
    worker_safety_ltir: 0.8
  governance:
    audit_status: "compliant"

```

### QS/CB Anchoring for ESG

- **QS (Pre-Event)**: Predicted environmental impact before production/operation
- **CB (Post-Event)**: Actual measured impact after production/operation
- **Delta Analysis**: Compare prediction to actual for continuous improvement

**Example**:
```
QS: Predicted carbon footprint = 1,500 kg CO₂e
CB: Actual carbon footprint = 1,250 kg CO₂e
Delta: 17% better than predicted (model improvement)
```

## Step 4: Set Your ESG Baseline

Before implementing improvements, establish your baseline.

## Step 6: Track Transformation Value

### Quarterly Value Assessment

Calculate transformation value across four dimensions:

```
Cost Savings = Baseline Costs - Current Costs
Revenue Growth = ESG-Driven New Revenue
ROI (%) = [(Total Economic Value - Investment) / Investment] × 100
```

**Environmental**:
```
GHG Avoided (tonnes CO₂e) = Baseline Emissions - Current Emissions
Environmental Value (€) = GHG Avoided × Carbon Price
```

**Social**:
```
Jobs Created = Direct + Indirect + Induced Jobs
Social Value (€) = Jobs × Average Salary × Social Multiplier (2.5)
```

**Innovation**:
```
Patents Filed = ESG-related patents
IP Value (€) = Patents × Average Patent Value
```

**Tools**:
- Transformation Value Calculator (available on ESG Portal)
- Quarterly Reporting Template

**Documentation**: [Transformation Value Metrics](./04-TRANSFORMATION_VALUE/VALUE_METRICS.md)
