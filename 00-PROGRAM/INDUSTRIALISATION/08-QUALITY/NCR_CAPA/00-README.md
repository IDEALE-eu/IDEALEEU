Non-Conformance Reports (NCR) and Corrective/Preventive Action (CAPA).

## Non-Conformance Report (NCR)

### Overview
NCR documents product or process non-conformances, ensures proper disposition, and drives corrective action.

### NCR Process
1. **Identification:** Discover non-conformance (inspection, test, customer)
2. **Containment:** Tag and quarantine non-conforming material
3. **Documentation:** Complete NCR with details
4. **Disposition:** Determine corrective action
5. **Implementation:** Execute disposition
6. **Verification:** Confirm effectiveness
7. **Closure:** Close NCR with approval

### Dispositions
- **Use-As-Is:** No rework, engineering approval required
- **Rework:** Repair to meet requirements, re-inspect
- **Scrap:** Destroy non-conforming material
- **Return to Supplier:** For supplier-caused defects
- **Sort/Screen:** Inspect population, segregate good from bad

### NCR Workflow
- Originator completes description and evidence
- Quality reviews and assigns to MRB (Material Review Board)
- Engineering determines disposition
- Manufacturing implements disposition
- Quality verifies and closes

## Material Review Board (MRB)

### Composition
- Quality engineer (chair)
- Manufacturing engineer
- Design engineer
- Other SMEs as needed

### Authority
- Approve use-as-is (within limits of delegation)
- Approve rework procedures
- Scrap material
- Return to supplier
- Escalate to customer if outside authority

## Corrective Action (CA)

### Purpose
Eliminate root cause of non-conformance to prevent recurrence.

### CA Process (8D or similar)
1. **Form Team:** Cross-functional
2. **Define Problem:** Clear problem statement
3. **Interim Action:** Contain and protect customer
4. **Root Cause Analysis:** 5 Whys, fishbone, fault tree
5. **Corrective Actions:** Address root causes
6. **Implement:** Execute corrective actions
7. **Verify Effectiveness:** Confirm problem solved
8. **Prevent Recurrence:** Standardize, share learning
9. **Close:** Document and recognize team

### Root Cause Analysis Tools
- **5 Whys:** Ask "why" repeatedly to find root cause
- **Fishbone (Ishikawa):** Categorize potential causes (man, machine, material, method, measurement, environment)
- **Fault Tree Analysis:** Logic diagram for failures
- **Pareto Analysis:** Identify vital few causes (80/20 rule)

## Preventive Action (PA)

### Purpose
Proactively address potential non-conformances before they occur.

### PA Triggers
- Trend analysis of NCRs or defects
- Near-miss events
- Lessons learned from other programs
- Audit findings
- Risk assessments (PFMEA)

### PA Process
Similar to CA, but addresses potential rather than actual problems.

## Metrics

### NCR Metrics
- **NCR rate:** NCRs per units produced
- **Cost of quality:** Scrap + rework costs
- **Cycle time:** Days to close NCRs
- **Repeat NCRs:** Same problem recurring

### CAPA Metrics
- **Open CAPAs:** Backlog of open actions
- **Overdue CAPAs:** Past due date
- **Effectiveness:** % of CAPAs preventing recurrence
- **Cycle time:** Days to close CAPA
