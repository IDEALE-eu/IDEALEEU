# AS9102_FAI

First Article Inspection per AS9102 standard.

## Overview

FAI (First Article Inspection) provides objective evidence that production processes can produce parts conforming to requirements.

## AS9102 Requirements

FAI required for:
- New part production
- Engineering change affecting fit/form/function
- Process change or relocation
- Tooling change
- After production suspension >2 years
- Customer request

## FAI Package Contents

### Form 1: Part Number Accountability
- Part identification and traceability
- Accountability for all characteristics on drawing

### Form 2: Product Accountability
- Drawing balloon numbers
- Characteristic descriptions
- Specifications and tolerances
- Actual measurements (min 3 samples)
- Measurement methods
- Results (conform/non-conform)

### Form 3: Process Verification
- Verification of product manufacturing processes
- Process flow referenced
- PFMEA and control plan referenced
- Special process certifications

## FAI Execution

1. **Select samples:** 3-5 parts from first production run
2. **Full dimensional layout:** Measure all characteristics
3. **Functional testing:** Per specification
4. **Material verification:** Certifications reviewed
5. **Special process verification:** Certs and records
6. **Document:** Complete Forms 1, 2, 3
7. **Review and approval:** Quality and engineering signatures
8. **Submit:** To customer if required

## Acceptance Criteria

- All characteristics within tolerance
- All material certifications present
- All special processes qualified
- All documentation complete and accurate

## Partial FAI

For engineering changes:
- Only affected characteristics need full verification
- Reference previous FAI for unchanged features
- Document what changed and verification performed

## FAI Records

- Retain permanently for flight-critical parts
- Minimum 10 years for non-critical parts
- Digital archival with secure backup
