# GAUGE_CALIBRATION

Measurement equipment and calibration program.

## Overview

Calibration ensures measurement equipment provides accurate and reliable results. All gages and measurement equipment require periodic calibration.

## Calibration Program

### Equipment Categories
- **Class A:** Precision measurement (CMM, micrometers)
- **Class B:** Production gages (calipers, indicators)
- **Class C:** Reference standards (gage blocks, ring gages)

### Calibration Frequency
- Varies by equipment type and usage
- Typical: Annual, semi-annual, or quarterly
- Risk-based: Critical measurements more frequent

### Calibration Process
1. **Identify:** All measurement equipment inventoried
2. **Schedule:** Track due dates, prevent overdue
3. **Calibrate:** Accredited lab or in-house (if qualified)
4. **Label:** Calibration sticker with due date
5. **Records:** Maintain calibration certificates
6. **Out-of-tolerance:** Recall and re-measure affected parts

## Standards

- ISO/IEC 17025: Calibration laboratory requirements
- ANSI/NCSL Z540.3: Calibration requirements
- AS9100: Quality management system requirements
