# SHOULD_COST

Should-cost modeling and target costing analysis.

## Overview

Should-cost models estimate what a product should cost based on design, materials, processes, and reasonable margins. Used for supplier negotiations and internal cost targets.

## Should-Cost Components

### Material Cost
- Bill of materials with quantities
- Material prices (market or supplier quotes)
- Scrap and yield factors
- Packaging and freight

### Labor Cost
- Standard hours per operation
- Labor rates (including burden)
- Learning curve adjustments

### Overhead
- Factory overhead rate (% of direct labor or machine hour rate)
- Includes utilities, depreciation, supervision, maintenance

### Tooling and Equipment
- Tooling cost amortized over production volume
- Equipment depreciation or lease cost

### Profit Margin
- Reasonable profit for supplier or internal target
- Varies by industry and complexity

## Should-Cost Development

1. **Product breakdown:** Components and assemblies
2. **Process definition:** How each part is made
3. **Time estimation:** Standard times for each operation
4. **Rate application:** Labor and overhead rates
5. **Material pricing:** Current market prices
6. **Summation:** Roll up to total cost
7. **Comparison:** Actual vs. should-cost

## Should-Cost Uses

### Supplier Negotiations
- Identify cost drivers
- Challenge supplier quotes
- Negotiate based on data

### Design-to-Cost
- Target cost for new designs
- Trade-offs to meet cost targets
- Value engineering opportunities

### Make/Buy Decisions
- Compare internal should-cost to supplier quotes
- Inform sourcing strategy

## Cost Reduction

### Opportunities
- Material substitution
- Process optimization
- Design simplification
- Supplier consolidation
- Volume leverage

### Tracking
- Actual cost vs. should-cost over time
- Cost reduction initiatives and savings
- Learning curve progress
