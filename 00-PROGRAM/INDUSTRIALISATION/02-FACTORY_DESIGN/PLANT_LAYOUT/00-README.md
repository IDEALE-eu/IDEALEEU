# PLANT_LAYOUT

Overall facility layout and material flow planning.

## Plant Layout Documentation

This directory contains the overall facility layout designs for both aircraft and spacecraft manufacturing operations.

## Layout Principles

### Material Flow
- **Unidirectional Flow** - Minimize backtracking and crossovers
- **Point of Use Storage** - Materials near consumption point
- **Minimal Handling** - Reduce touch points and moves
- **Clear Pathways** - Designated aisles and transport routes

### Zoning Strategy
1. **Receiving and Inspection** - Incoming materials and quality checks
2. **Component Manufacturing** - Machine shops, composites, fabrication
3. **Sub-Assembly** - Component integration and sub-systems
4. **Final Assembly** - Main aircraft/spacecraft assembly
5. **Test and Inspection** - Functional testing and quality verification
6. **Shipping and Logistics** - Finished goods and delivery preparation

## Material Flow Analysis

### From-To Matrix
Document the movement of materials between work centers to identify high-frequency flows and optimize layout.

### Spaghetti Diagram
Visual representation of material travel paths to identify opportunities for flow improvement.

### Takt Time Alignment
Ensure work center spacing and capacity aligns with takt time requirements.
