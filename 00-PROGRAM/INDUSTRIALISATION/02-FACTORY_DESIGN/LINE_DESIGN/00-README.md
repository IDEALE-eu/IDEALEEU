Production line layout and work center design for manufacturing operations.

## Line Design Documentation

This directory contains detailed production line layouts and work center designs for aircraft and spacecraft manufacturing.

## Line Design Principles

### Lean Manufacturing
1. **One-Piece Flow** - Minimize batch sizes and WIP
2. **Takt Time Pacing** - Synchronize production rate with demand
3. **Standard Work** - Consistent methods and sequence
4. **Visual Controls** - Andon lights, work instructions, status boards
5. **Error Proofing** - Poka-yoke devices to prevent defects

### Line Balancing
- Balance workload across stations
- Minimize idle time and bottlenecks
- Achieve target takt time
- Flexibility for mixed-model production

### Workstation Design
- Ergonomic height and reach
- Tools and materials within reach zone
- Clear work instructions and visual aids
- Quality checkpoints integrated

3. **Quality Checksheet** - Inspection points and criteria
4. **Tool List** - Required tools and equipment
5. **Safety Requirements** - PPE, hazards, precautions

## Line Balancing Analysis

### Balancing Methodology
1. **List all tasks** with time estimates
2. **Calculate takt time** = Available time / Demand
3. **Group tasks** into stations meeting takt time
4. **Optimize** to minimize idle time
5. **Validate** with time studies

### Balancing Metrics
- **Line Efficiency** = Sum of station times / (Number of stations Ã— Takt time)
- **Balance Delay** = 100% - Line Efficiency
- **Smoothness Index** - Measures variability between stations

### Example: Aircraft Assembly Line Balancing

| Station | Tasks | Time (min) | Takt (min) | Utilization |
|---------|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Fuselage join | 960 | 1200 | 80% |
| 2 | Wing integration | 1440 | 1200 | 120% (bottleneck) |
| 3 | Empennage | 960 | 1200 | 80% |
| 4 | Systems install | 2400 | 1200 | 200% (2 parallel) |
| 5 | Propulsion | 1440 | 1200 | 120% (bottleneck) |
| 6 | Final closeout | 960 | 1200 | 80% |

**Action Items:**
- Station 2: Add tooling to reduce time or split tasks
- Station 4: Parallel stations required
- Station 5: Process improvement needed

## Mixed-Model Capability

### Flexibility Planning
- Design for multiple product variants
- Quick-change tooling and fixtures
- Modular workstation components
- Cross-trained workforce

### Changeover Reduction (SMED)
- Single Minute Exchange of Dies principles
- External setup tasks (done while running)
- Internal setup tasks (requires line stop)
- Target: <30 minutes changeover time

## Visual Management

### Line Status Board
- Current unit in each station
- Schedule vs. actual
- Quality issues (open/closed)
- Andon events (help requests)

### Andon System
