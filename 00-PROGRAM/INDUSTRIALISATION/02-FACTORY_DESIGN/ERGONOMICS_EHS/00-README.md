# ERGONOMICS_EHS

Ergonomics analysis and Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) planning for manufacturing operations.

## Overview

This directory contains ergonomic assessments, health and safety analyses, and environmental compliance documentation for all manufacturing work centers and processes.

## Ergonomics Program

### Objectives
1. **Injury Prevention** - Reduce musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)
2. **Productivity** - Improve worker efficiency and quality
3. **Worker Well-being** - Enhance job satisfaction and reduce fatigue
4. **Compliance** - Meet OSHA and regulatory requirements

### Ergonomic Assessment Methods

#### RULA (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment)
- Assesses upper limb postures and repetitive tasks
- Score 1-7 scale (1-2 acceptable, 7 immediate action)
- Focus: Arms, wrists, neck, trunk

#### REBA (Rapid Entire Body Assessment)
- Whole-body postural analysis
- Score 1-15 scale (1 negligible risk, 15 very high risk)
- Includes load handling and force considerations

#### NIOSH Lifting Equation
- Calculates recommended weight limits for lifting tasks
- Considers: Load weight, horizontal distance, vertical height, asymmetry
- Output: Lifting Index (LI < 1.0 acceptable)

#### Job Strain Index (JSI)
- Evaluates hand-intensive tasks
- Considers: Force, repetition, posture, duration, effort
- Score < 3 low risk, > 7 high risk

### Ergonomic Design Standards
