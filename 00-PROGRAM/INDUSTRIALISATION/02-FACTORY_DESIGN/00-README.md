## Overview

Factory design encompasses the physical layout of manufacturing facilities, production lines, and work centers, ensuring efficient material flow, worker safety, and optimal use of space and resources.

## Key Principles

### Lean Layout Principles
1. **Flow Optimization** - Minimize transportation and movement
2. **Value Stream Mapping** - Design around value-adding activities
3. **Cellular Manufacturing** - Group similar processes
4. **Pull Systems** - Kanban and JIT material delivery
5. **Visual Management** - Clear signage, andon boards, visual controls

### Safety and Ergonomics
1. **Ergonomic Workstations** - Reduce strain and injury risk
2. **Safety Zones** - Clear demarcation of hazardous areas
3. **Emergency Access** - Fire exits, first aid, emergency equipment
4. **Housekeeping** - 5S implementation (Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain)
5. **PPE Requirements** - Personal protective equipment by zone

### Environmental Considerations
1. **Energy Efficiency** - Lighting, HVAC optimization
2. **Waste Management** - Recycling, hazardous waste handling
3. **Noise Control** - Acoustic treatments in high-noise areas
4. **Ventilation** - Fume extraction, air quality management
5. **Sustainability** - Green building practices

## Design Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Definition
- Production volume and mix
- Process sequence and flow
- Equipment specifications
- Material handling requirements
- Workforce sizing

### Phase 2: Conceptual Layout
- Block layout diagrams
- Material flow analysis
- Space allocation
- Utility routing
- Future expansion planning

### Phase 3: Detailed Design
- Detailed CAD layouts
- Equipment placement
- Workstation design
- Safety and egress planning
- Utility connection points

### Phase 4: Validation
- 3D simulation and walk-throughs
- Ergonomic assessments
- Safety reviews
- Lean assessments
- Stakeholder reviews

## Deliverables

1. **Plant Layout Drawings** - Overall facility layout with zones and flows
2. **Line Layout Drawings** - Detailed production line layouts
3. **Workstation Designs** - Individual work center specifications
4. **Material Flow Diagrams** - From-to charts and spaghetti diagrams
5. **Safety and EHS Plans** - Hazard assessments and mitigation
6. **Ergonomics Reports** - Workstation ergonomic evaluations
