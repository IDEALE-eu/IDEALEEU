# PM_PLANS

Preventive maintenance schedules and procedures.

## Overview

PM plans define maintenance tasks, frequency, and procedures to keep equipment reliable and productive.

## PM Plan Development

### Equipment Inventory
- List all production equipment
- Include critical specifications
- Assign equipment numbers

### Manufacturer Recommendations
- Review equipment manuals
- Follow OEM PM schedules
- Adapt to actual usage

### Criticality Assessment
- **Critical:** Breakdown stops production, no backup
- **Important:** Causes delays, backup available
- **Non-critical:** Minimal impact if down

### PM Task Definition
- Inspections
- Lubrication
- Adjustments and calibrations
- Parts replacement (filters, belts, etc.)
- Cleaning

### PM Frequency
- Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual
- Based on time or usage (hours, cycles)
- More frequent for critical equipment

## PM Procedures

### Procedure Content
- Equipment identification
- Task description
- Tools and materials required
- Safety precautions
- Step-by-step instructions
- Inspection criteria
- Documentation requirements

### PM Execution
- Schedule PM during planned downtime
- Assign to qualified technicians
- Follow procedure exactly
- Document completion
- Tag equipment with next PM due date

## PM Tracking

### PM Schedule
- Master schedule for all equipment
- Alerts for upcoming PMs
- Track PM completion vs. schedule
- Target: 100% on-time PM compliance

### PM Software (CMMS)
- Computerized Maintenance Management System
- PM scheduling and work orders
- PM history and trends
- Spare parts tracking
- Integration with ERP

## PM Performance

### Metrics
- **PM Compliance:** % completed on time
- **Downtime:** Planned PM hours vs. unplanned breakdowns
- **Cost:** PM cost vs. breakdown cost
- **MTBF:** Increasing MTBF indicates effective PM

### Continuous Improvement
- Analyze breakdown root causes
- Adjust PM frequency or tasks
- Add PdM for critical equipment
- Kaizen PM procedures for efficiency
