## Spare Parts Management

### Critical Spares
- Identify long-lead or single-source parts
- Stock based on criticality and lead time
- Maintain min/max inventory levels

### Spare Parts Inventory
- Organized and labeled
- Controlled access (prevent pilferage)
- Track usage and replenishment
- Link to PM schedules for planned usage

### Spare Parts in CMMS
- Part numbers and descriptions
- Stock levels and locations
- Lead times and suppliers
- Usage history

## Tool Control

### Tool Crib
- Centralized tool storage
- Check-out/check-in system
- Prevents loss and damage
- Ensures tools available when needed

### Tool Tracking
- Shadow boards for visual control
- Barcode or RFID for automated tracking
- Inspection and calibration tracking
- Replacement schedule for consumables

### Calibrated Tools
- Torque wrenches, micrometers, gauges
- Calibration schedule per requirements
- Calibration stickers and records
- Remove from service if overdue

## FOD (Foreign Object Debris) Prevention

### Tool Accountability
- Count tools before and after task (especially critical areas)
- Tool usage logs
- Immediate report if tool missing

### FOD Control
