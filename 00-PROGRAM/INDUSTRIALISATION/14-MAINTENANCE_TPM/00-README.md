## Overview

Effective maintenance ensures equipment reliability, minimizing unplanned downtime and supporting consistent production.

## Maintenance Types

### Preventive Maintenance (PM)
- Scheduled maintenance (time-based or usage-based)
- Inspections, lubrication, adjustments, parts replacement
- Reduces breakdowns and extends equipment life

### Predictive Maintenance (PdM)
- Condition-based maintenance
- Vibration analysis, oil analysis, thermography
- Maintenance only when needed (more efficient than PM)

### Corrective Maintenance
- Repair after failure
- Minimize through PM and PdM
- Emergency response for critical equipment

## Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)

### TPM Pillars
1. **Autonomous Maintenance:** Operators perform routine maintenance
2. **Planned Maintenance:** Scheduled PM and PdM
3. **Quality Maintenance:** Maintain equipment to prevent defects
4. **Focused Improvement:** Kaizen to reduce losses
5. **Early Equipment Management:** Design for maintainability
6. **Training:** Develop maintenance skills
7. **Safety, Health, Environment:** Safe and clean workplace
8. **TPM in Administration:** Extend TPM to office processes

### TPM Metrics
- **MTBF:** Mean Time Between Failures (higher is better)
- **MTTR:** Mean Time To Repair (lower is better)
- **OEE:** Overall Equipment Effectiveness (target â‰¥ 85%)
- **PM Compliance:** % of PM completed on schedule (target 100%)
