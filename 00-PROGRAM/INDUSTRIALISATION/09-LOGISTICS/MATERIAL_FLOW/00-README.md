# MATERIAL_FLOW

Material flow and handling systems for manufacturing operations.

## Overview

Material flow design ensures efficient movement of materials from receiving through production to shipping.

## Material Flow Principles

- **Unidirectional flow:** Avoid backtracking
- **Minimal handling:** Reduce touches and moves
- **Point-of-use delivery:** Materials near consumption point
- **Standard containers:** Consistent packaging and handling
- **Gravity flow:** Use gravity where possible

## Material Handling Equipment

- Forklifts and pallet jacks
- Conveyors and automated guided vehicles (AGVs)
- Hoists and cranes
- Carts and dollies
- Automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS)

## Material Flow Analysis

- From-to charts: Movement frequency between areas
- Spaghetti diagrams: Visual path of materials
- Cycle time analysis: Time in transport and queue
- Value-added vs. non-value-added time

## Lean Material Flow

- **Kanban:** Pull signals for replenishment
- **Milk runs:** Scheduled material delivery routes
- **Supermarkets:** Controlled inventory storage at point-of-use
- **Water spider:** Dedicated material handler for production area
