# KITTING

Kit preparation and line-side delivery for production.

## Overview

Kitting prepares all materials needed for a work order or production unit, delivered as a complete kit to the production line.

## Kitting Benefits

- Reduces line-side inventory
- Eliminates parts shortages (if kit complete)
- Simplifies material handling
- Improves traceability
- Reduces operator search time

## Kitting Process

1. **Kit definition:** MBOM defines kit contents
2. **Kit pick:** Pick parts from warehouse per work order
3. **Kit verification:** Confirm all parts present and correct
4. **Kit staging:** Hold until production sequence
5. **Kit delivery:** Deliver to line at scheduled time
6. **Empties return:** Return containers for reuse

## Kitting Methods

### Complete Kit
- All parts for entire assembly in one kit
- Simple, but large kit size

### Progressive Kits
- Multiple kits per assembly, staged by operation
- Smaller kits, easier to handle

### Kanban Kitting
- High-volume parts delivered via kanban
- Low-volume parts kitted
- Hybrid approach

## Kit Storage and Presentation

- **Kit carts:** Mobile carts with bins
- **Kit shelves:** Stationary shelves at work centers
- **Sequence kits:** Kits sequenced in production order
- **Labeled containers:** Clear identification

## Kitting Accuracy

- Target: 99.5% kit accuracy
- Barcode scanning for verification
- Visual verification by kit picker
- Inspection by quality or production
