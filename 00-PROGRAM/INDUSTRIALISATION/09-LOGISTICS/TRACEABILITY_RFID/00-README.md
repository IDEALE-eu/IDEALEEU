# TRACEABILITY_RFID

Material traceability and RFID tracking systems.

## Overview

Traceability systems track materials, components, and assemblies throughout manufacturing, enabling recall and quality investigations.

## Traceability Requirements

### AS9100 Requirements
- Material certifications retained and traceable
- Lot/batch traceability for critical items
- Serial number tracking for flight-critical assemblies
- Ability to trace forward (where material was used) and backward (what material was used)

### Regulatory Requirements
- Part 21 (FAA): Design approval and production
- EASA Part 21: Similar requirements
- Traceability to support airworthiness

## Traceability Levels

### Lot Traceability
- Track by manufacturer lot/batch number
- Multiple parts from same lot
- Typical for raw materials, fasteners, standard components

### Serial Number Traceability
- Each part has unique serial number
- Track individual part through all operations
- Required for flight-critical, life-limited parts

## Traceability Methods

### Manual (Paper)
- Travelers with lot/serial numbers recorded
- Material certs attached to work orders
- Labor intensive, error prone

### Barcode
- 1D or 2D barcodes on parts and containers
- Scan at each operation
- Links to database
- Reduced errors, faster

### RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
- RFID tags on parts or containers
- Automatic read (no line-of-sight required)
- Real-time location tracking
- Higher cost, but most automated

## Traceability Data

### Material Traceability
- Material specification (alloy, grade)
- Heat lot or batch number
- Material certifications (mill test reports)
- Supplier and date received

### Process Traceability
- Operations performed and sequence
- Date and shift of operation
- Operator identification
- Equipment/tooling used
- Inspection results

### Assembly Traceability
- Components installed (lot/serial numbers)
- Assembly date and location
- Final inspection and test results
- Delivery to customer

## RFID Technology

### RFID Components
- **Tags:** Passive (no battery) or active (battery-powered)
- **Readers:** Fixed or handheld
- **Antennas:** For reading tags
- **Software:** Middleware and database

### RFID Applications
- **Tool tracking:** RFID tags on tools for accountability
- **WIP tracking:** Real-time location of assemblies
- **Material tracking:** Automated receiving and inventory
- **Process tracking:** Automatic operation recording

### RFID Benefits
- No line-of-sight required (vs. barcode)
- Read multiple tags simultaneously
- Real-time data without manual scanning
- Reduced labor and errors

### RFID Challenges
- Higher cost than barcodes
- Metal and liquid can interfere with RF signals
- Requires infrastructure (readers, antennas)
- Data management and integration

## Traceability Reports

### Genealogy Report (Where-Used)
- Given a lot/serial number, show where it was used
- Identify all assemblies containing suspect material
- Critical for recalls or quality investigations

### As-Built Report (What-Used)
- Given an assembly serial number, show all materials/components used
- Complete bill-of-material as-built configuration
- Required for flight-critical assemblies

## Traceability Records

- Permanent retention for flight-critical parts
- Minimum 10 years for non-critical
- Digital archival with secure backup
- Protect against data loss
