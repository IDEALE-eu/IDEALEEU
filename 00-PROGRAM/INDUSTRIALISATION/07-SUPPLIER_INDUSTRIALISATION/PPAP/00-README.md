# PPAP

Production Part Approval Process for supplier qualification.

## Overview

PPAP demonstrates that supplier understands customer requirements and can consistently produce conforming parts at the specified production rate.

## PPAP Submission Levels

- **Level 1:** Warrant only (for low-risk changes)
- **Level 2:** Warrant + sample and limited supporting data
- **Level 3:** Warrant + sample and complete supporting data
- **Level 4:** Warrant + complete supporting data (no sample)
- **Level 5:** Warrant + sample + complete data + on-site review

Aerospace typically requires Level 3 or 5.

## PPAP Approval

- Customer reviews submission package
- Approve, reject, or request additional information
- Approval required before production shipments
- Validity: Until part/process change or quality issue

## PPAP Triggers (Re-submission Required)

- New part or part family
- Engineering design change
- Process or material change
- Tooling change or refurbishment
- Production moved to new location
- Production after tooling inactive >12 months
- Customer request (quality issues)

## Supplier Performance Monitoring

After PPAP approval:
- On-time delivery tracking
- Quality metrics (PPM defects)
- Corrective action responsiveness
- Cost reduction initiatives
- Continuous improvement
