# RIGS_ATE

Test rigs and Automated Test Equipment for functional and performance testing.

## Overview

Test rigs and ATE verify functional performance and simulate operational conditions to ensure product meets requirements.

## Test Rig Types

### Functional Test Stands
- Verify operational requirements
- Simulate interfaces and loads
- Measure performance parameters
- Example: Actuator test stand (force, stroke, speed)

### Environmental Test Chambers
- **Thermal:** Temperature cycling, thermal soak
- **Altitude:** Low-pressure simulation
- **Humidity:** Moisture exposure
- **Vibration:** Sine, random, shock
- **Acoustic:** High-intensity sound

### Automated Test Equipment (ATE)
- Computer-controlled testing
- Automated data acquisition
- Pass/fail criteria programmed
- High throughput, repeatability

## Test Rig Design

### Requirements
- Simulate operational environment
- Measure critical parameters accurately
- Safe operation (fail-safes, emergency stops)
- Calibrated instrumentation
- Data logging and reporting

### Components
- **Fixtures:** Hold unit under test (UUT)
- **Sensors:** Measure parameters (pressure, temperature, force, displacement)
- **Actuators:** Apply inputs (hydraulic, pneumatic, electric)
- **Data Acquisition:** Record test data
- **Control System:** PLC or computer control
- **Safety:** Guards, interlocks, e-stops

## Test Procedures

### Test Procedure Content
- Test objectives and acceptance criteria
- Setup instructions
- Step-by-step test sequence
- Data to be recorded
- Safety precautions
- Troubleshooting guidance

### Test Execution
1. **Setup:** Install UUT, verify connections
2. **Calibration Check:** Verify instrumentation
3. **Pre-test Inspection:** Visual check of UUT
4. **Run Test:** Execute per procedure
5. **Data Collection:** Automated or manual recording
6. **Post-test Inspection:** Check for damage
7. **Data Analysis:** Compare to acceptance criteria
8. **Report:** Document results, pass/fail

## Test Data Management

### Data Recording
- Automated: Data acquisition system logs data
- Manual: Operator records on test sheet
- Time-stamped and traceable to UUT

### Data Analysis
- Compare to specification limits
- Statistical analysis (mean, std dev, Cpk)
- Trend charting over time
- Outlier identification

### Data Storage
- Link test data to serial number
- Permanent retention for flight-critical
- Minimum 10 years for non-critical

## Test Equipment Qualification

### Gage R&R
- Evaluate repeatability and reproducibility
- Ensure measurement system adequate

### Correlation Studies
- Compare test rig results to actual flight data
- Validate test accuracy

### Calibration
- Periodic calibration of all instrumentation
- Traceable to NIST standards
- Calibration stickers and records

## Safety

### Test Rig Hazards
- High pressure or force
- Electrical hazards
- Moving parts
- Hot/cold surfaces

### Safety Controls
- Guards and barriers
- Interlocks (prevent operation with guards open)
- Emergency stop buttons
- Lockout/tagout procedures
- Personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Operator training
