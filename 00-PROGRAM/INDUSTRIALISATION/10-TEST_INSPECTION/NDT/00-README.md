# NDT

Non-Destructive Testing equipment and procedures.

## Overview

NDT equipment and procedures for detecting defects without damaging parts. See also **03-PROCESS_PLANNING/SPECIAL_PROCESSES/NDT/** for detailed NDT procedures.

## NDT Equipment

### Ultrasonic Testing (UT)
- Flaw detectors (pulse-echo)
- Through-transmission systems
- C-scan automated scanners
- Transducers (various frequencies and sizes)
- Couplant (gel or water)

### Radiographic Testing (RT)
- X-ray machines (portable and cabinet)
- Isotope sources (Ir-192, Co-60)
- Film or digital detectors
- Processing equipment (for film)
- Viewing screens and software

### Liquid Penetrant Testing (PT)
- Penetrant (visible dye or fluorescent)
- Developer (dry, wet, non-aqueous)
- UV lights (for fluorescent)
- Cleaning supplies

### Magnetic Particle Testing (MT)
- Magnetizing equipment (prods, yokes, coils)
- Magnetic particles (dry or wet, visible or fluorescent)
- Field indicators (to verify field strength)
- Demagnetizers

### Eddy Current Testing (ET)
- Eddy current instruments
- Probes (surface, sliding, encircling)
- Reference standards
- Conductivity meters

## NDT Equipment Maintenance

- Daily function checks
- Periodic calibration per procedure
- Preventive maintenance per manufacturer
- Repair by qualified technicians
- Records of maintenance and calibration

## NDT Reference Standards

- Known defects for calibration and validation
- Material-specific standards
- Standard test blocks (aluminum, steel, titanium)
- Penetrameters (IQI) for radiography

## NDT Personnel

- Certified per NAS 410 or ASNT SNT-TC-1A
- Levels I, II, III
- Vision tested annually
- Records of certification maintained
