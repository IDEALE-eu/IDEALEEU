# FUNCTIONAL_TEST

Functional and performance testing procedures.

## Overview

Functional testing verifies that assemblies and systems operate per specification under simulated or actual operational conditions.

## Aircraft Functional Tests

### Systems Testing
- **Electrical Systems:** Power distribution, lighting, avionics
- **Hydraulic Systems:** Pressure, flow, actuator operation
- **Fuel Systems:** Fuel transfer, pressure, leak checks
- **Environmental Control:** Pressurization, air conditioning
- **Flight Controls:** Actuation, rates, forces

### Ground Testing
- **Power-on checks:** Electrical systems energized
- **Taxi tests:** Low-speed ground operation
- **Engine run:** Ground engine operation and checks
- **Pre-flight checks:** Final verification before flight

### Flight Testing
- **First flight:** Initial airworthiness demonstration
- **Envelope expansion:** Gradually expand flight envelope
- **Performance tests:** Speed, range, climb rate, etc.
- **Certification tests:** Demonstrate compliance with certification basis

## Spacecraft Functional Tests

### Component-Level Testing
- Individual subsystems tested before integration
- Electrical, mechanical, thermal functional verification

### Subsystem Integration Testing
- Interface compatibility
- Command and telemetry functionality
- Power distribution and consumption

### Spacecraft-Level Testing
- **Functional test:** All systems operational
- **Thermal-vacuum:** Simulate space environment
- **Vibration test:** Launch loads
- **Acoustic test:** Launch acoustic environment
- **EMI/EMC test:** Electromagnetic compatibility
- **Mass properties:** Weight, CG, moments of inertia

### Launch Site Testing
- Final functional checks after shipping
- Integrated tests with launch vehicle
- Pre-launch verification

## Test Procedures

### Procedure Development
- Based on design specifications
- Acceptance criteria defined
- Step-by-step instructions
- Data collection requirements
- Safety precautions

### Test Execution
- Follow approved procedure
- Record all data (automated and manual)
- Document any anomalies
- Deviation requires engineering approval

### Test Review
- Compare results to acceptance criteria
- Engineering review of anomalies
- Approve or reject for next phase

## Test Reports

### Content
- Test identification (procedure number, date)
- Unit under test (serial number)
- Test conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.)
- Test results (data, pass/fail)
- Anomalies and resolutions
- Signatures (test engineer, quality, engineering)

### Record Retention
- Permanent for flight-critical systems
- Minimum 10 years for non-critical

## Failure Investigation

### When Test Fails
1. **Stop test:** Secure unit and equipment
2. **Document:** Record failure mode and conditions
3. **Notify:** Engineering and quality
4. **Investigate:** Root cause analysis
5. **Corrective action:** Fix unit and/or procedure
6. **Re-test:** Verify fix effective

## Automated vs. Manual Testing

### Automated
- **Advantages:** Fast, repeatable, data logging
- **Disadvantages:** Setup cost, programming effort
- **Best for:** High-volume, repetitive tests

### Manual
- **Advantages:** Flexible, low setup cost
- **Disadvantages:** Slower, operator-dependent
- **Best for:** Low-volume, varied tests
