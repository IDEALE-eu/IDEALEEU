## Overview

Compliance links ensure traceability from requirements through design, manufacturing, test, and into service. Configuration management maintains product integrity.

## Configuration Management

- Product baseline (what is built)
- As-designed vs. as-built configuration
- Engineering change control
- Effectivity management (serial number ranges)

## Digital Thread

Seamless data flow:
- Requirements → Design → Manufacturing → Quality → Service
- Traceability forward and backward
- Single source of truth
- Automated data exchange
