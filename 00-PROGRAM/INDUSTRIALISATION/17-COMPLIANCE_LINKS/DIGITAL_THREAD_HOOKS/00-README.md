# DIGITAL_THREAD_HOOKS

Digital thread integration points and data flow.

## Overview

Digital thread connects engineering, manufacturing, quality, and service data into a seamless, traceable flow.

## Digital Thread Flow

```
Requirements (PLM)
  ↓
Design (CAD/PLM)
  ↓
EBOM (PLM)
  ↓
MBOM (ERP) + Routings
  ↓
Work Orders (MES)
  ↓
Manufacturing (MES) + Quality (QMS)
  ↓
As-Built Configuration (Traceability)
  ↓
Delivery (ERP)
  ↓
Service/MRO (Field Data)
```

## Integration Points

### PLM ↔ ERP
- EBOM → MBOM transformation
- Engineering changes (ECNs) flow to ERP
- Design release triggers MBOM creation

### ERP ↔ MES
- Work orders from ERP to MES
- Material consumption and labor back to ERP
- Real-time production status

### MES ↔ QMS
- Inspection results from QMS to MES
- NCRs and holds communicated
- As-built data captured

### Traceability
- Lot/serial numbers tracked through all systems
- As-built genealogy (what was used)
- Where-used (where lot/serial was installed)

## Data Standards

- Common part numbering
- Standard data formats (XML, JSON APIs)
- Master data management
- Data governance and ownership

## Benefits of Digital Thread

- **Traceability:** Complete product genealogy
- **Efficiency:** Eliminate manual data entry
- **Accuracy:** Single source of truth
- **Visibility:** Real-time status across enterprise
- **Analytics:** Data-driven decision making

## Challenges

- System integration complexity
- Data quality and consistency
- Change management (people and process)
- Cybersecurity
