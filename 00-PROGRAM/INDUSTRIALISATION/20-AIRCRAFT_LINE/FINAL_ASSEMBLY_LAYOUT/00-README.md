# FINAL_ASSEMBLY_LAYOUT

Aircraft final assembly line layout and configuration.

## Overview

Final assembly layout optimizes aircraft flow through assembly stations, minimizing cycle time and maximizing quality.

## Layout Principles

- **Progressive Build:** Aircraft moves through sequential stations
- **Takt Time Pacing:** Station cycle times balanced to takt time
- **Overhead Cranes:** Material handling for heavy components
- **Systems Access:** Adequate space for systems installation and test
- **Ergonomics:** Platforms and lifts for operator access

## Assembly Stations

### Station 1: Fuselage Join (2-3 days)
- Mate forward, center, and aft fuselage sections
- Primary structure fastening
- Install floor panels and primary systems interfaces

### Station 2: Wing Mate (2-3 days)
- Lift wings and mate to fuselage
- Wing-to-body fastening and sealing
- Flight control linkages
- Wing systems connection (fuel, hydraulic, electrical)

### Station 3: Empennage (2 days)
- Install horizontal and vertical stabilizers
- Control surface attachment
- Tail systems integration

### Station 4: Systems Installation (5-7 days)
- Hydraulic system installation and testing
- Electrical/avionics installation and testing
- Environmental control systems
- Landing gear installation
- Interior components

### Station 5: Propulsion Integration (3-4 days)
- Engine or propulsion unit installation
- Fuel system connection and testing
- Nacelle and cowling installation
- Ground run preparation

### Station 6: Final Closeout (2-3 days)
- Panels, doors, and fairings
- Final inspections (dimensional, functional)
- Ground testing (systems, propulsion)
- Paint preparation (if applicable)

## Material Handling

- Overhead cranes (20+ ton capacity)
- Work platforms and scaffolding
- Component transport dollies
- Jacking and leveling equipment

## Utilities

- Electrical power (ground power units)
- Compressed air and nitrogen
- Hydraulic test stands
- Fuel/propellant (for ground testing)
