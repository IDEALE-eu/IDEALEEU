## Overview

Aircraft final assembly line brings together all major components (fuselage, wings, empennage, systems, propulsion) into complete aircraft.

## Key Considerations

### Aircraft-Specific
- Large assembly requiring high-bay facility
- Heavy crane and lift equipment
- Multiple assembly stations (progressive build)
- Systems integration complexity
- Final testing and ground run

### Integration with Common Sections
- Uses processes from **03-PROCESS_PLANNING**
- Quality per **08-QUALITY**
- Logistics per **09-LOGISTICS**
- Training per **13-TRAINING_COMPETENCY**
