# STARTUP_READINESS

Aircraft final assembly line startup and commissioning.

## Overview

Startup readiness ensures the aircraft assembly line is fully prepared for production, including facilities, equipment, workforce, processes, and suppliers.

## Startup Phases

### Phase 1: Facility Commissioning (Months 1-2)
- Facility construction complete
- Utilities operational (power, air, HVAC)
- Safety systems certified (fire, emergency)
- Cranes and lifts installed and certified

### Phase 2: Equipment Installation (Months 3-4)
- Assembly fixtures installed
- Tooling delivered and qualified
- Ground support equipment (GSE) operational
- Test equipment calibrated

### Phase 3: Process Validation (Months 5-6)
- Dry runs without aircraft
- Process validation with prototype or iron bird
- Work instruction refinement
- Cycle time validation

### Phase 4: Workforce Readiness (Months 5-7)
- Personnel hired and trained
- Competency assessments passed
- Team-building and readiness exercises
- Cross-training for flexibility

### Phase 5: Supply Chain Validation (Months 6-8)
- Supplier PPAP approvals
- Delivery performance validated
- Strategic inventory established
- Logistics (kitting, material flow) operational

### Phase 6: IT Systems Go-Live (Months 7-8)
- ERP, MES, QMS systems operational
- Work order generation tested
- Traceability validated
- Reporting and dashboards functional

### Phase 7: Prototype Build (Month 9)
- First aircraft assembly
- Learning and process refinement
- Lessons learned documented
- FAI and PRR preparation

### Phase 8: LRIP Ramp (Months 10-12)
- Initiate low-rate initial production
- Monitor performance (FPY, cycle time, cost)
- Continuous improvement
- Prepare for full-rate production

## Startup Checklist

See **11-PRR/CHECKLISTS/** for detailed Production Readiness Review checklist.

## Risk Management

### Startup Risks
- Facility delays (construction, permitting)
- Equipment delivery or commissioning issues
- Workforce hiring or training delays
- Supplier readiness gaps
- IT system integration problems

### Mitigation
- Critical path tracking and contingency plans
- Early supplier engagement and APQP
- Parallel training and hiring pipeline
- Phased IT rollout and testing
- Dedicated startup team and management focus

## Success Criteria

- First aircraft delivered on schedule
- Quality targets met (FPY â‰¥ 80% for prototype)
- Cost within 25% of target (prototype learning expected)
- Safety: Zero lost-time incidents
- Team morale high, lessons learned captured
