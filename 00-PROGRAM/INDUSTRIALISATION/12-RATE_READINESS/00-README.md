## Overview

Rate readiness ensures manufacturing can achieve target production rates with stable quality and cost.

## Key Metrics

- **Takt Time:** Available time / Customer demand
- **Cycle Time:** Actual time to complete operation
- **OEE:** Overall Equipment Effectiveness (Availability × Performance × Quality)
- **Throughput:** Units per time period
- **Capacity Utilization:** Actual output / Theoretical capacity

## Rate Readiness Assessment

### Capacity Verification
- Capacity model by work center
- Identify constraints (bottlenecks)
- Validate through production runs

### Process Stability
- First Pass Yield ≥ 85% (LRIP), ≥ 90% (full rate)
- Process capability Cpk ≥ 1.33
- Low variability in cycle times

### Supply Chain Capability
- Suppliers capable of delivering to rate
- On-time delivery ≥ 95%
- Strategic inventory for long-lead items
