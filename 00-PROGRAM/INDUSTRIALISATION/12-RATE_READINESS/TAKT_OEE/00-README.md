# TAKT_OEE

Takt time and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) tracking.

## Takt Time

### Definition
Takt time = Available production time / Customer demand

### Example
- Available time: 8 hours × 60 min = 480 minutes
- Demand: 20 units/day
- Takt time: 480 / 20 = 24 minutes per unit

### Use
- Design stations to meet takt time
- Pace production to customer demand
- Visualize target vs. actual cycle time

## Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)

### Definition
OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality

### Availability
- Availability = Operating time / Planned production time
- Losses: Breakdowns, setup/changeovers, unplanned downtime

### Performance
- Performance = (Actual cycle time / Ideal cycle time) × 100%
- Losses: Minor stops, reduced speed

### Quality
- Quality = Good units / Total units produced
- Losses: Scrap, rework

### World-Class OEE
- OEE ≥ 85% is world-class
- OEE 60-85% typical for aerospace
- OEE < 60% indicates significant losses

## OEE Tracking

- Measure daily by equipment or line
- Identify loss categories
- Focus improvement on largest losses
- Track improvement over time

## Six Big Losses

1. **Breakdowns:** Equipment failures
2. **Setup/Changeover:** Product changeovers
3. **Small Stops:** Minor, frequent stops
4. **Reduced Speed:** Operating below ideal
5. **Startup Rejects:** Scrap during startup
6. **Production Rejects:** Scrap during production
