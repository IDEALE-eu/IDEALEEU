## Overview

Integrated IT systems enable digital thread, real-time visibility, and data-driven decision making across the manufacturing enterprise.

## Digital Thread

EBOM (PLM) → MBOM (ERP) → Work Orders (MES) → As-Built (QMS) → Service (MRO)

## System Integration

- Data flows between systems automatically
- Eliminate manual re-entry and errors
- Single source of truth for each data type
- Real-time visibility across functions

## Key Systems

### PLM/PDM
- Engineering data (CAD, specs, BOMs)
- Change management (ECNs)
- Document control

### ERP
- MBOM and routings
- Material requirements planning (MRP)
- Purchasing and inventory
- Financial (costing, invoicing)

### MES
- Shop floor execution
- Work order tracking
- Labor and material transactions
- Real-time production status

### QMS
- Inspection data and NCRs
- CAPA management
- Certificates of conformance
- Audit management
