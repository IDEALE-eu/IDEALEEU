- **EVIDENCE/** - Supporting evidence and documentation

## Overview

PRR is a formal review to verify manufacturing readiness before committing to full-rate production. It assesses capability, capacity, quality systems, and supply chain readiness.

## PRR Objectives

- Verify manufacturing processes are stable and capable
- Confirm quality systems are in place and effective
- Validate supply chain readiness
- Assess workforce training and competency
- Confirm IT systems operational
- Verify tooling and equipment qualified
- Assess cost and schedule compliance

## PRR Timing

Typically conducted at key milestones:
- **PRR-1:** After prototype build, before LRIP
- **PRR-2:** After LRIP Phase 1, before LRIP Phase 2
- **PRR-3:** After LRIP Phase 2, before full-rate production

## PRR Checklist Categories

   - Design freeze
   - ECN closure rate acceptable
   - Technical data packages complete

2. **Process Planning**
   - Process flows documented
   - PFMEA and control plans complete
   - Special processes qualified

3. **Tooling and Equipment**
   - Production tooling installed and qualified
   - Equipment capacity adequate
   - Maintenance plans in place

4. **Quality Systems**
   - FAI complete per AS9102
   - MSA and process capability demonstrated (Cpk â‰¥ 1.33)
   - NCR/CAPA system operational
   - Inspection plans approved

5. **Supply Chain**
   - Critical suppliers PPAP approved
   - Supplier delivery performance acceptable
   - Strategic inventory established

6. **Workforce**
   - Personnel hired and trained
   - Special process operators certified
   - Skill matrix complete

7. **IT Systems**

   - Work order generation functional
   - Traceability systems validated

8. **Facilities**
   - Production space adequate
   - Environmental controls operational
   - Safety systems certified

9. **Logistics**

   - Kitting processes defined
   - Warehouse systems operational

10. **Cost and Schedule**
    - Cost per unit at or below target
    - Learning curve tracking on plan
    - Capacity model validated

## PRR Process

1. **Pre-Review:** Distribute checklist, collect evidence
2. **Self-Assessment:** Manufacturing completes checklist
3. **Evidence Review:** Quality and engineering review evidence
4. **PRR Meeting:** Present findings to leadership
5. **Action Items:** Address open issues
6. **Approval:** Formal approval to proceed or hold

## PRR Approval Criteria

### Go Decision
- All critical items complete
- Minor items have action plans
- Cost and schedule on track
- Quality and delivery metrics acceptable

### Conditional Go
- Some items incomplete but action plans in place
- Risk mitigation defined
- Close monitoring required

### No-Go (Hold)
- Critical items incomplete
- High risk of quality or delivery failure
- Repeat PRR after corrective actions
