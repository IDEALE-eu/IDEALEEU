  - Minimum ceiling height: 15m
  - Floor space: 10,000+ m²
  - Crane capacity: 20+ tons
  - Clean air environment (optional for composites)

- **Component Manufacturing**
  - Machine shop: CNC, 5-axis machining
  - Composites facility: Autoclave, clean room
  - Sheet metal shop: Press brakes, forming equipment
  - Assembly areas: Sub-assembly stations

#### Spacecraft AIT Facility
- **Cleanroom Requirements**
  - ISO Class 7 (Class 10,000) minimum
  - Floor space: 2,000+ m²
  - Environmental controls: Temperature ±2°C, humidity ±5%
  - Electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection

- **Test Facilities**
  - Thermal vacuum chambers
  - Vibration test stands

   - Tier 1 supplier proximity
   - Logistics infrastructure (airports, ports, rail)

2. **Talent Availability**
   - Aerospace engineering talent pool
   - Skilled manufacturing workforce
   - Training institutions and partnerships

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Electrical power capacity and reliability
   - Water and utilities
   - Transportation access
   - Communication networks

4. **Regulatory Environment**
   - Aerospace certification authority access
   - Environmental regulations
   - Labor regulations
   - Tax incentives and grants

5. **Cost Considerations**
   - Real estate costs
   - Labor costs
   - Utility costs
   - Tax burden

### Footprint Options

#### Option A: Integrated Campus
**Description:** Single-site facility with all manufacturing, assembly, and test capabilities.

**Advantages:**
- Reduced logistics complexity
- Faster communication and problem-solving
- Lower transportation costs
- Unified quality management

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher capital investment
- Single point of failure risk
- May not optimize for all locations

#### Option B: Distributed Network
**Description:** Multiple facilities specialized by function (component manufacturing, final assembly, test).

**Advantages:**
- Optimize each site for specific capabilities
- Risk distribution
- Potential labor cost advantages
- Regional presence

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex logistics
- Higher coordination overhead
- Transportation costs and risks
- Configuration management challenges

#### Option C: Hybrid Approach
**Description:** Core assembly and test at primary site, selected components at satellite facilities.

**Advantages:**
- Balance of integration and optimization
- Flexibility for growth
- Risk mitigation

**Disadvantages:**
- Moderate complexity
- Requires strong supply chain management

### Recommended Approach

[TBD - To be determined based on program requirements and business case analysis]

## Capacity Planning

### Production Rate Targets
- **Year 1:** Prototype and LRIP (Low Rate Initial Production) - 2-5 units
- **Year 2-3:** LRIP ramp - 10-20 units/year
- **Year 4+:** Full Rate Production - 50+ units/year

### Space Requirements by Phase

| Phase | Aircraft Facility | Spacecraft Facility | Total |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Prototype | 3,000 m² | 1,000 m² | 4,000 m² |
| LRIP | 7,000 m² | 1,500 m² | 8,500 m² |
| Full Rate | 15,000 m² | 3,000 m² | 18,000 m² |

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Utilities
- Electrical: 5+ MW capacity with redundancy
- Compressed air: Industrial grade, dry, oil-free for cleanrooms
