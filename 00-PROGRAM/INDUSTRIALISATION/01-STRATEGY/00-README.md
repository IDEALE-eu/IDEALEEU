## Overview

The industrialisation strategy establishes the foundational decisions for manufacturing operations, including where to manufacture, what to make internally versus source externally, and how to ramp from prototype to full-rate production.

## Strategic Considerations

### Manufacturing Footprint
- Facility location and capacity
- Geographic considerations (proximity to suppliers, customers, talent)
- Capital investment requirements
- Infrastructure and utility requirements

### Make/Buy Strategy
- Core competency identification
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Risk assessment (supply chain, IP, quality)
- Capacity and capability evaluation

### Ramp Planning
- Production rate milestones
- Resource requirements (labor, equipment, facilities)
- Supply chain readiness
- Learning curve assumptions

## Deliverables

1. **Manufacturing Footprint Analysis** - Site selection criteria and recommendations
2. **Make/Buy Matrix** - Categorization of all components and assemblies
3. **Ramp Plan** - Month-by-month production plan from prototype to full rate
4. **Capital Equipment Plan** - Major equipment purchases and timelines
5. **Workforce Plan** - Hiring and training schedule
