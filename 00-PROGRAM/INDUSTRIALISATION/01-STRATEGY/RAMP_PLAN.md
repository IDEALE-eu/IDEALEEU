# RAMP_PLAN

Production ramp-up plan and rate readiness timeline from prototype to full-rate production.

## Production Ramp Overview

### Ramp Philosophy
The production ramp follows a phased approach balancing learning curve effects, supply chain maturity, workforce training, and process stability.

### Key Principles
1. **Quality First** - Never compromise quality for rate
2. **Stable Processes** - Validate before increasing rate
3. **Supply Chain Pacing** - Align with supplier readiness
4. **Workforce Readiness** - Training precedes rate increase
