# LESSONS LEARNED FROM PROTOTYPE BUILD

**Program:** [Program Name]  
**Phase:** Prototype Build  
**Date:** [Date]  
**Participants:** [Participants]

## Overview

This document captures lessons learned during the prototype build phase to inform LRIP and full-rate production planning.

## What Went Well

### Design
- Wing structure design performed as expected
- Composite layup procedures well-documented
- Material selection appropriate

### Processes
- CNC machining met tolerance requirements
- NDT inspection processes effective
- Assembly fixtures functioned well

### Team
- Cross-functional collaboration strong
- Problem-solving mindset prevalent
- Willingness to work extended hours

## Challenges and Issues

### Design Issues
- **Issue:** Interference between hydraulic lines and structure
  - **Impact:** Rework required, 3-day delay
  - **Root Cause:** Incomplete 3D model, not caught in design review
  - **Fix:** Modified routing per ECN-001
  - **Prevention:** Enhanced 3D modeling and interference checking before release

- **Issue:** Fastener callouts unclear on drawings
  - **Impact:** Incorrect fasteners installed, required rework
  - **Root Cause:** Drawing ambiguity
  - **Fix:** Drawing revised per ECN-002
  - **Prevention:** Drawing review checklist enhanced

### Process Issues
- **Issue:** Composite cure cycle longer than specified
  - **Impact:** Extended schedule, increased cost
  - **Root Cause:** Autoclave heating rate capability
  - **Fix:** Cure cycle adjusted
  - **Prevention:** Equipment qualification before production, update cure specs

- **Issue:** Final assembly tooling insufficient access for torquing
  - **Impact:** Ergonomic challenges, potential FOD risk
  - **Root Cause:** Tooling design did not consider tool clearance
  - **Fix:** Modified tooling
  - **Prevention:** Ergonomic review and tool access check in tooling design phase

### Supply Chain Issues
- **Issue:** Landing gear delivery 6 weeks late
  - **Impact:** Assembly delay
  - **Root Cause:** Supplier capacity constraint
  - **Fix:** Expedited delivery (premium cost)
  - **Prevention:** Earlier supplier engagement, APQP process, dual sourcing for critical items

- **Issue:** Material certifications missing on delivery
  - **Impact:** Receiving inspection delay
  - **Root Cause:** Supplier process lapse
  - **Fix:** Obtained certs from supplier
  - **Prevention:** PPAP requirements reinforced, supplier audit

### Workforce Issues
- **Issue:** Insufficient composite technicians
  - **Impact:** Overtime required, schedule pressure
  - **Root Cause:** Underestimated labor hours for prototype
  - **Fix:** Hired additional technicians
  - **Prevention:** Better time estimates, training pipeline established

- **Issue:** Operator confusion with work instructions
  - **Impact:** Errors, rework
  - **Root Cause:** Text-heavy instructions, no photos
  - **Fix:** Added photos and diagrams
  - **Prevention:** Visual work instructions standard, operator feedback during development

### Quality Issues
- **Issue:** Inspection plan incomplete for some operations
  - **Impact:** Unclear acceptance criteria, rework
  - **Root Cause:** Rushed inspection plan development
  - **Fix:** Completed inspection plans
  - **Prevention:** Inspection plans required before production, quality review gate

- **Issue:** Process capability not demonstrated before production
  - **Impact:** High scrap and rework rate
  - **Root Cause:** No capability study performed
  - **Fix:** Conducted Cpk studies, adjusted processes
  - **Prevention:** Cpk ≥ 1.33 required before PRR approval

## Recommendations for LRIP and Full-Rate Production

### Design
1. Complete 3D interference checking before drawing release
2. Enhanced drawing review checklist (fasteners, clarity)
3. DFM/DFA reviews with manufacturing before design freeze

### Processes
4. Equipment qualification (autoclaves, tooling) before production
5. Process validation and capability studies (Cpk) before PRR
6. Ergonomic reviews and tool access checks for all tooling

### Supply Chain
7. Early supplier engagement and APQP for critical items
8. PPAP approval before production (including certs)
9. Dual sourcing strategy for high-risk items
10. Supplier audits and performance monitoring

### Workforce
11. Accurate time estimates using time studies and learning curves
12. Training pipeline established ahead of ramp
13. Visual work instructions with photos/diagrams standard
14. Operator feedback incorporated during procedure development

### Quality
15. Inspection plans complete and approved before production
16. Process capability (Cpk ≥ 1.33) demonstrated before PRR
17. PFMEA and control plans reviewed and implemented
18. First Article Inspection (FAI) per AS9102 before LRIP

### IT Systems
19. ERP, MES, and QMS operational before LRIP
20. Traceability system validated

## Metrics Summary - Prototype Build

- **First Pass Yield:** 75% (target for LRIP: ≥85%)
- **Scrap Rate:** 8% (target for LRIP: <5%)
- **Rework Rate:** 17% (target for LRIP: <10%)
- **Schedule:** 15% behind (3 weeks late)
- **Cost:** 25% over budget (learning and rework)

## Action Items for LRIP Readiness
