# SQDCME DASHBOARD

Safety, Quality, Delivery, Cost, Morale, and Environment performance dashboard.

## Dashboard Overview

SQDCME is a lean manufacturing performance measurement framework covering all critical dimensions of operations.

## S - SAFETY

### Metrics
- **TRIR (Total Recordable Incident Rate):** Recordable incidents per 100 FTE
  - Target: <1.0
  - World-class: <0.5
- **DART Rate:** Days Away, Restricted, or Transferred per 100 FTE
  - Target: <0.5
- **Near Misses Reported:** Leading indicator
  - Target: Increasing trend (shows engagement)
- **Days Since Last Incident:** Safety milestone tracker

### Actions for Poor Performance
- Safety stand-downs and retraining
- Enhanced hazard identification and mitigation
- Ergonomic assessments
- Leadership safety walks

## Q - QUALITY

### Metrics
- **First Pass Yield (FPY):** % units passing first time without rework
  - Target LRIP: ≥85%
  - Target Full Rate: ≥90%
- **Scrap Rate:** % parts/materials scrapped
  - Target: <2%
- **Rework Rate:** % units requiring rework
  - Target: <5%
- **Customer Returns:** Defects per million (PPM)
  - Target: <100 PPM
- **Cpk:** Process capability index
  - Target: ≥1.33

### Actions for Poor Performance
- Root cause analysis (5 Whys, fishbone)
- PFMEA review and update
- Enhanced inspection or SPC
- Operator retraining
- Process improvements (Kaizen)

## D - DELIVERY

### Metrics
- **On-Time Delivery (OTD):** % deliveries on or before promise date
  - Target: ≥95%
- **Schedule Adherence:** % of schedule achieved
  - Target: ≥90%
- **Late Deliveries:** Count and days late
  - Target: Decreasing trend
- **Cycle Time:** Lead time from order to delivery
  - Target: Continuous reduction

### Actions for Poor Performance
- Bottleneck analysis and relief
- Supplier performance improvement
- Capacity additions
- Lead time reduction initiatives
- Better scheduling and planning

## C - COST

### Metrics
- **Cost Per Unit:** Actual vs. target
  - Target: At or below target
- **Cost Variance:** % over/under budget
  - Target: ±5%
- **Productivity:** Standard hours earned / actual hours
  - Target: 85-100%
- **Material Variance:** Material cost vs. standard
  - Target: ±3%
- **Learning Curve:** Hours vs. cumulative quantity
  - Target: On or better than plan curve

### Actions for Poor Performance
- Value engineering and cost reduction initiatives
- Supplier cost negotiations
- Process improvements (reduce cycle time, scrap, rework)
- Make/buy re-evaluation
- Automation opportunities

## M - MORALE

### Metrics
- **Employee Engagement:** Survey score
  - Target: ≥80% favorable
- **Turnover Rate:** % employees leaving annually
  - Target: <10%
- **Training Completion:** % of required training complete
  - Target: 100%
- **Absenteeism:** % unplanned absences
  - Target: <3%
- **Kaizen Suggestions:** Number submitted per employee
  - Target: ≥2 per year

### Actions for Poor Performance
- Employee engagement surveys and action planning
- Recognition and reward programs
- Career development and training
- Communication and transparency
- Work-life balance initiatives

## E - ENVIRONMENT

### Metrics
- **Waste Diversion Rate:** % waste recycled vs. landfilled
  - Target: ≥75%
- **Energy Consumption:** kWh per unit produced
  - Target: Year-over-year reduction
- **Water Usage:** Gallons per unit produced
  - Target: Year-over-year reduction
- **VOC Emissions:** Tons per year
  - Target: Compliance and reduction
- **Hazardous Waste:** Pounds generated per unit
  - Target: Minimization

### Actions for Poor Performance
- Waste reduction initiatives
- Recycling programs
- Energy efficiency improvements (LED lighting, efficient HVAC)
- Process changes to reduce emissions
- Material substitution

## Dashboard Format

### Daily Tier Meetings
- Review metrics at production team level
- Identify issues and assign action items
- 15-minute stand-up meetings

### Weekly Management Reviews
- Department-level metrics
- Trend analysis
- Action plan reviews
- 30-60 minute meetings

### Monthly Executive Reviews
- Enterprise-level dashboard
- Strategic initiatives
- Resource allocation decisions
- Investment approvals

## Continuous Improvement

- Set targets based on historical performance and benchmarks
- Track trends over time (not just current value)
- Celebrate successes
- Learn from failures (root cause analysis)
- Share best practices across organization
