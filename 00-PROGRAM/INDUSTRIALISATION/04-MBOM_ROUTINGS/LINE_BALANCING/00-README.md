# LINE_BALANCING

Line balancing analysis and optimization for manufacturing operations.

## Overview

Line balancing ensures workload is evenly distributed across production stations to achieve takt time, minimize idle time, and maximize throughput.

## Balancing Process

1. **List tasks** with standard times
2. **Calculate takt time** = Available time / Demand rate
3. **Group tasks** into stations ≤ takt time
4. **Calculate metrics:**
   - Line efficiency = Σ task times / (stations × takt)
   - Balance delay = 1 - efficiency
   - Smoothness index = measure of variability
5. **Iterate** to optimize balance

## Tools and Methods

- **Yamazumi charts:** Visual load balancing
- **Precedence diagrams:** Task dependencies
- **Simulation software:** Digital validation
- **Time studies:** Validate assumptions

## Outputs

- Balanced station assignments
- Takt time achievement plan
- Operator requirements by station
- Bottleneck identification
- Improvement opportunities
