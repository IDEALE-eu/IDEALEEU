## Process Flow Analysis

### Cycle Time Reduction Opportunities
- **Eliminate:** Non-value-added steps (waiting, transport, excess inventory)
- **Combine:** Sequential operations that can be done in parallel
- **Simplify:** Reduce complexity and handoffs
- **Automate:** Repetitive, high-volume operations

### Bottleneck Identification
- Calculate capacity at each step
- Identify constraint operations (longest cycle time)
- Focus improvement efforts on bottlenecks
- Balance line to takt time

### Quality Gate Placement
- **Critical operations:** Verify before proceeding (100% inspection)
- **High-risk operations:** Enhanced inspection or SPC
- **Standard operations:** Sample inspection or first-piece check

## Process Flow Documentation Standards
