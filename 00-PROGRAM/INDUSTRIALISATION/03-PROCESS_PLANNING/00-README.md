## Overview

Process planning defines how products will be manufactured, including detailed process flows, risk analysis (PFMEA), quality controls, and special process requirements. This documentation is critical for ensuring consistent, repeatable, and high-quality manufacturing.

## Key Elements

### Process Flow
- Value stream mapping
- Process sequence and routing
- Cycle times and capacities
- Material and information flow

### PFMEA (Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)
- Identify potential process failures
- Assess risk (Severity × Occurrence × Detection)
- Define preventive and detective controls
- Risk mitigation action plans

### Control Plans
- Process parameters and tolerances
- Inspection methods and frequencies
- Reaction plans for out-of-control situations
- Statistical Process Control (SPC) requirements

### Special Processes
- Processes that cannot be fully verified by inspection
- Require qualification and continuous monitoring
- Examples: Welding, heat treatment, composites, NDT, bonding, coating

## Integration with Quality

Process planning is tightly integrated with quality systems:
- PFMEA drives control plan requirements
- Control plans define inspection plans
- Special processes require operator certification
- Process capability studies (Cpk) validate controls
