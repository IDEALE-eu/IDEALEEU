# COMPOSITES

Composite manufacturing process specifications and procedures.

## Overview

Composite manufacturing processes for aerospace structures, including layup, curing, and quality control requirements.

## Composite Processes

### Hand Layup
- Dry fabric placement
- Resin application (wet layup or prepreg)
- Ply orientation verification
- Debulking between plies
- Vacuum bagging

### Automated Tape Laying (ATL)
- CNC fiber placement
- In-situ consolidation
- Automated ply cutting
- Repeatability and precision

### Automated Fiber Placement (AFP)
- Multiple tow placement
- Complex geometries
- Optimized fiber paths
- Steering and cut/restart capability

### Resin Transfer Molding (RTM)
- Dry preform placement
- Mold closure
- Resin injection
- Cure in closed mold

### Out-of-Autoclave (OOA)
- Vacuum-only curing
- Oven cure
- Lower equipment cost
- Process control challenges

## Composite Materials

### Prepreg Systems
- **Carbon/Epoxy:** High strength, aerospace primary structures
- **Glass/Epoxy:** Lower cost, secondary structures
- **Aramid/Epoxy:** Impact resistance, interior panels

### Resin Systems
- **Epoxy:** General purpose, good mechanical properties
- **BMI (Bismaleimide):** High temperature applications
- **PEEK (Polyether ether ketone):** Thermoplastic, tough, repairable

### Reinforcement Forms
- **Unidirectional tape:** 0° reinforcement
- **Woven fabric:** Balanced 0°/90° or multi-axial
- **Non-crimp fabric (NCF):** Stitched multi-axial, minimal crimp

## Process Parameters

### Critical Parameters
- **Temperature:** Cure profile (ramp rate, hold temp, hold time)
- **Pressure:** Autoclave pressure or vacuum level
- **Time:** Total cure cycle time
- **Humidity:** Storage and layup environment
- **Ply Orientation:** Fiber angle accuracy (±5° typical)

### Monitoring and Recording
- **Thermocouples:** Multiple locations in laminate
- **Pressure Transducers:** Autoclave or vacuum bag
- **Data Acquisition:** Continuous recording at 1 Hz minimum
- **Cure Cycle Chart:** Permanent record for each cure

## Autoclave Curing

### Equipment Qualification
- **Temperature uniformity:** ±5°F throughout work zone
- **Pressure control:** ±5 psi of target
- **Heating/cooling rates:** Capable of meeting cure cycle

### Typical Cure Cycle (Aerospace Epoxy Prepreg)
1. **Ramp:** 2-5°F/min to 350°F
2. **Hold:** 2 hours at 350°F and 85 psi
3. **Cool:** <5°F/min to <150°F before removing

### Vacuum Bagging
- **Vacuum level:** 22-28 inches Hg (full vacuum)
- **Bag materials:** Release film, breather, bag film, sealant tape
- **Leak check:** Hold vacuum for 15 minutes before cure

## Quality Control

### In-Process Inspection
- **Ply count verification:** Count and record each ply
- **Orientation check:** Verify fiber angle each ply
- **Foreign object debris (FOD):** Visual inspection, clean environment
- **Resin flow:** Check for proper wet-out (prepreg) or fill (RTM)
- **Vacuum integrity:** Monitor vacuum throughout cure

### Post-Cure Inspection
- **Visual:** Surface defects, porosity, wrinkles
- **Ultrasonic (UT):** Void content, delaminations
- **Thickness:** Verify laminate thickness
- **Fiber volume fraction:** Destructive sample (burnoff test)
- **Mechanical testing:** Coupons for strength and modulus

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Void content:** <2% by volume (aerospace structural)
- **Porosity:** Minimal to none visible on surface
- **Delaminations:** None detected by UT
- **Wrinkles:** None in load-bearing plies
- **Dimensional:** Within tolerance per drawing

## Material Storage and Handling

### Storage Requirements
- **Freezer storage:** Prepregs at 0°F or colder
- **Shelf life:** Tracked from manufacture date
- **Out-time:** Cumulative time at room temperature
- **Humidity control:** <60% RH during layup

### Material Control
- **Lot tracking:** Batch number for traceability
- **Out-time tracking:** Log-in/log-out from freezer
- **Expiration enforcement:** Reject expired material
- **FIFO:** First-in, first-out usage

## Operator Qualification

### Training Requirements
- **Composite theory:** Materials, processes, quality issues
- **Hands-on practice:** Supervised layups
- **Process-specific:** Each process (hand layup, ATL, AFP, RTM)
- **Part-specific:** Critical aerospace parts

### Certification
- **Written exam:** Composite fundamentals
- **Practical exam:** Layup demonstration to standard
- **Re-certification:** Annual or per company requirement

## Process Specifications

### Specification Content
- Material call-out (prepreg system, resin, fabric)
- Ply schedule (sequence, orientation, count)
- Cure cycle (temperature, pressure, time profile)
- Vacuum bagging details (materials, configuration)
- Quality requirements (inspection points, acceptance criteria)

### Change Control
- Engineering approval for any deviation
- Process validation for significant changes
- PFMEA review for risk assessment

## Environmental, Health, and Safety

### Hazards
- **Skin irritation:** Epoxy sensitization
- **Respiratory:** Dust from cutting, VOCs during cure
- **Ergonomic:** Repetitive motion in hand layup

### Controls
- **PPE:** Gloves, aprons, respirators (organic vapor for wet layup)
- **Ventilation:** Local exhaust for cutting/sanding operations
- **Ergonomics:** Adjustable tables, assist devices for large parts
