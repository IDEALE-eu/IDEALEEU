# SPECIAL_PROCESSES

Special manufacturing processes requiring qualification and continuous monitoring.

## Overview

Special processes are manufacturing operations where the output cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection or testing. These processes require qualified procedures, equipment, and operators, with continuous process monitoring.

## Special Process Categories

### Composites Manufacturing
- Layup and lamination
- Autoclave curing
- Out-of-autoclave (OOA) processes
- Resin infusion

### Welding and Joining
- Fusion welding (TIG, MIG, laser)
- Resistance welding
- Friction stir welding
- Brazing and soldering

### Heat Treatment
- Aluminum heat treat (solution, aging)
- Steel heat treat (hardening, tempering)
- Stress relief
- Surface hardening

### Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)
- Ultrasonic testing
- Radiographic testing
- Penetrant testing
- Eddy current testing

### Additional Special Processes
- Adhesive bonding
- Painting and coating
- Chemical processing (anodizing, chemical milling)
- Shot peening
- Plating (electroplating, electroless)

## Special Process Requirements

### Process Qualification
1. **Procedure Specification** - Detailed written procedure
2. **Equipment Qualification** - Demonstrate equipment capability
3. **Process Validation** - Prove process produces acceptable results
4. **Range Qualification** - Establish acceptable parameter ranges

### Operator Qualification
- **Training:** Theoretical and hands-on training
- **Certification:** Written and practical examination
- **Re-certification:** Periodic re-qualification (annual or per standard)
- **Records:** Maintain certification records

### Equipment Qualification
- **Installation Qualification (IQ):** Installed per specifications
- **Operational Qualification (OQ):** Operates within parameters
- **Performance Qualification (PQ):** Produces acceptable results
- **Re-qualification:** After major maintenance or relocation

### Continuous Monitoring
- **Process Parameters:** Real-time monitoring and recording
- **Statistical Process Control:** Trend analysis
- **Periodic Audits:** Verify compliance with procedures
- **Corrective Actions:** Address out-of-specification conditions

## Non-Conformance

### When Special Process Fails
1. **Stop Process:** Immediately halt and quarantine parts
2. **Notify Quality:** Engineering and quality review required
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine failure mode and cause
4. **Corrective Action:** Fix process, may require re-qualification
5. **Disposition:** Scrap, rework, or use-as-is with engineering approval
