## Overview

Spacecraft AIT (Assembly, Integration, Test) requires cleanroom environment, precision tooling, and extensive testing to ensure flight readiness.

## Key Considerations

### Spacecraft-Specific
- Cleanroom (ISO Class 7 or better)
- ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) protection
- Contamination control (particulate, molecular)
- Environmental testing (thermal-vacuum, vibration)
- Precision alignment and metrology

### Integration with Common Sections
- Uses processes from **03-PROCESS_PLANNING**
- Quality per **08-QUALITY**
- Testing per **10-TEST_INSPECTION**
- Training per **13-TRAINING_COMPETENCY**
