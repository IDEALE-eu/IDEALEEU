# CLEANROOM_LAYOUT

Spacecraft AIT cleanroom facility layout and contamination controls.

## Overview

Cleanroom provides controlled environment for spacecraft assembly, protecting sensitive components from contamination.

## Cleanroom Classification

### ISO Class 7 (Class 10,000)
- **Particle count:** ≤10,000 particles (≥0.5 µm) per cubic foot
- **Use:** General spacecraft assembly and integration
- **Air changes:** 60-90 per hour
- **HEPA filtration:** 99.97% efficient at 0.3 µm

### ISO Class 6 or 5 (if required)
- Stricter particle limits for optical components or sensitive instruments
- Laminar flow hoods within cleanroom

## Cleanroom Zones

### Entry Airlock
- Gowning area
- Air shower
- Positive pressure gradient into cleanroom

### Component Preparation Area
- Receiving and inspection of components
- Cleaning and bagging
- Material staging

### Integration Area
- Main spacecraft assembly and integration
- Integration stands and fixtures
- Precision metrology and alignment

### Test Area
- Functional testing
- Pre-environmental checkout
- Data collection

### Storage Area
- Controlled storage for components and sub-assemblies
- Temperature and humidity control

## Cleanroom Controls

### HVAC System
- HEPA-filtered supply air
- Temperature: 20-24°C (±2°C)
- Humidity: 40-50% RH (±5%)
- Positive pressure (vs. outside): 0.02-0.05 inches water

### ESD Protection
- Conductive flooring and work surfaces
- Grounded wrist straps and heel straps
- ESD-safe garments and packaging
- Ionizers for charge neutralization

### Contamination Control
- Gowning protocol (cleanroom suits, gloves, masks, hoods)
- Material restrictions (low-outgassing materials only)
- Cleaning procedures and frequency
- Particle monitoring (continuous and periodic sampling)

### Access Control
- Restricted access (trained personnel only)
- Gowning compliance verification
- Material pass-through with cleaning

## Cleanroom Qualification

### Initial Certification
- Particle count verification per ISO 14644
- HVAC performance (airflow, temperature, humidity)
- Pressure differential verification

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Continuous particle monitoring
- Daily temperature and humidity logs
- Quarterly re-certification
- Annual full re-qualification
