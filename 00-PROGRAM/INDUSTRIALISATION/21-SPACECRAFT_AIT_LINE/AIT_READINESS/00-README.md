# AIT_READINESS

Spacecraft AIT line startup and commissioning readiness.

## Overview

AIT readiness ensures spacecraft assembly, integration, and test facility and processes are ready for production.

## Startup Phases

### Phase 1: Facility Commissioning (Months 1-3)
- Cleanroom construction complete
- HVAC and cleanroom certification (ISO Class 7)
- ESD controls installed and verified
- Environmental test chambers installed

### Phase 2: GSE Installation (Months 4-5)
- Integration stands and handling fixtures installed
- Electrical GSE and checkout systems operational
- Metrology equipment (laser trackers, CMM) calibrated
- Contamination control equipment in place

### Phase 3: Process Validation (Months 6-7)
- Dry runs without spacecraft
- Process validation with qualification unit or mockup
- Procedure refinement based on learning
- Cycle time validation

### Phase 4: Workforce Readiness (Months 6-8)
- Personnel hired and trained
- Cleanroom gowning and protocols training
- ESD awareness and compliance
- Competency assessments passed

### Phase 5: Supply Chain Validation (Months 7-9)
- Component supplier PPAP approvals
- Delivery performance validated
- Cleanroom-compatible packaging verified
- Receiving and inspection processes operational

### Phase 6: IT Systems Go-Live (Months 8-9)
- ERP, MES, QMS operational
- Spacecraft checkout system integrated
- Data acquisition and telemetry systems tested
- Traceability validated

### Phase 7: Qualification Unit Build (Month 10)
- First spacecraft integration
- Environmental testing (thermal-vac, vibration, acoustic)
- Lessons learned captured
- FAI and PRR preparation

### Phase 8: Flight Unit Production (Months 11+)
- Initiate flight unit production
- Monitor performance (yield, cycle time, cost)
- Continuous improvement
- Prepare for rate production

## Risk Management

### AIT Startup Risks
- Cleanroom certification delays
- Environmental test equipment commissioning issues
- Spacecraft checkout system integration problems
- Component supplier readiness gaps
- Workforce cleanroom protocol compliance

### Mitigation
- Early cleanroom qualification and monitoring
- Thorough GSE testing and validation
- Phased IT and checkout system rollout
- Early supplier engagement and APQP
- Rigorous training and compliance audits

## Success Criteria

- Qualification unit successfully integrated and tested
- Environmental tests passed (thermal-vac, vibration, acoustic)
- Cleanroom contamination levels maintained
- Quality targets met (minimal rework)
- Cost within 50% of target (qualification unit learning expected)
- Safety: Zero contamination or ESD incidents
- Lessons learned documented for flight units
