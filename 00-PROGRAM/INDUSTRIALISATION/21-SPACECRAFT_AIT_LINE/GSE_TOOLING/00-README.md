# GSE_TOOLING

Ground Support Equipment and spacecraft-specific tooling for AIT operations.

## Overview

GSE (Ground Support Equipment) provides mechanical, electrical, and environmental support during spacecraft assembly, integration, and test.

## Mechanical GSE

### Integration Stands
- Support spacecraft during integration
- Adjustable height and tilt
- Cleanroom-compatible (low-particle shedding)
- Access platforms for operators

### Handling Fixtures
- Lifting and rotating spacecraft or components
- Soft-capture mechanisms to prevent damage
- Precision alignment features

### Alignment Tooling
- Optical alignment telescopes
- Laser trackers and coordinate measuring
- Alignment cubes and fixtures

### Vibration Isolation
- Isolate spacecraft from floor vibrations
- Critical during precision operations

## Electrical GSE

### Spacecraft Checkout System
- Simulates spacecraft electrical interfaces
- Monitors telemetry and commands
- Power supply and distribution

### Electrical Test Equipment
- Multimeters, oscilloscopes, power supplies
- Hi-pot testers for insulation
- Continuity testers for harness verification

### Umbilical Cables
- Electrical connection to spacecraft
- Power, command, and telemetry
- Quick-disconnect for transport

## Environmental GSE

### Thermal-Vacuum Chamber
- Simulates space thermal environment
- Temperature: -150°C to +150°C (typical)
- Vacuum: <10^-6 torr
- LN2 shrouds for thermal simulation

### Vibration Table
- Simulates launch vibration (sine, random, shock)
- Multi-axis capability
- Control system for test profiles

### Acoustic Chamber
- High-intensity sound simulation (launch acoustic)
- 140+ dB sound pressure levels

### EMI/EMC Test Facility
- Anechoic or shielded chamber
- Electromagnetic compatibility testing

## Contamination Control GSE

### Cleanroom Wipes and Solvents
- Lint-free wipes (Texwipe or equivalent)
- Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for cleaning
- Vacuum cleaners (HEPA-filtered)

### Particle Monitors
- Airborne particle counters
- Surface particle monitors

### Protective Covers
- Component covers and bags (ESD-safe, cleanroom-compatible)
- Spacecraft covers during storage or transport

## GSE Calibration and Maintenance

- Periodic calibration per schedule
- Preventive maintenance
- Configuration control (GSE revision levels)
- Records and traceability

## GSE Qualification

- Functional testing before use
- Interface verification with spacecraft
- Operator training
- Acceptance per specification
