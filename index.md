# Aerospace Digital Passports, Reimagined

**IDEALE-EU** transforms aerospace lifecycle management through QS-anchored digital passports, ensuring tamper-proof provenance from design to retirement. Built on **UTCS manifests** with **QS pre-event superposition capture** and PLUMA automation, IDEALE-EU delivers the complete digital thread for mission-critical aerospace systems.

## Revolutionary platform delivering

**Immutable provenance** via **QS pre-event superposition capture** of UTCS manifests and **CB post-event anchoring** ensures every component’s history is cryptographically secured and instantly verifiable. **Complete lifecycle visibility** across all 9 CAx phases—from CAD design through **CAS services** and **end of life**—provides transparent traceability. **TFA (Threading Functional Architecture)** with 15 canonical domains structures complex aerospace data for efficient management. **PLUMA integration** automates lifecycle UiX workflows, reducing manual overhead while maintaining certification compliance.

The platform addresses key challenges: counterfeit prevention, instant certification verification, predictive maintenance through federated fleet learning, and sustainable technologies including H₂ systems tracking and energy-harvesting sensor integration.

### Automatic and Autonomous Digital Passport-iDP

**Purpose**  
Extend IDEALE-EU with an Automatic and Autonomous Digital Passport (iDP) that self-generates, validates, and maintains UTCS-anchored passports with minimal human input.

**Core functions**
- Autonomous registration: detect new parts or digital assets in PLM/ERP and auto-instantiate UTCS manifests.
- Self-verifying integrity: continuous QS pre-event capture with checksum drift detection and CB post-event anchoring.
- Cognitive validation: AI checks evidence completeness, certification schema conformance, and anomalies.
- Federated interaction: FE logic coordinates cross-party updates with QS↔CB handshakes.
- Smart evolution: learn lifecycle signatures and propose corrections or schema upgrades.
- Context sync: auto-merge CAD/CAE, PLM, and MRO metadata to keep threads consistent.

**Generative iDP capabilities**
- Corrective procedure paths with ECR/ECO-ready diffs.
- Cryptographic roadmaps with key rotation and PQC plans.
- Schedule prediction for inspections and audits at object/entity level.
- UTCS extensions (YAML) and control notes auto-drafted from context.

**Components**

| Layer      | Module               | Function                                                           |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Detection  | Event Monitors       | Watch PLM/ERP/MES/CAD repos for new or modified entities           |
| Generation | iDP Constructor      | Compose UTCS templates, assign IDs, start QS capture               |
| Validation | Compliance Engine    | Verify schema integrity, evidence links, regulatory alignment      |
| Anchoring  | QS/CB Anchor Service | Manage pre-event capture, post-event proofs, immutable logs        |
| Federation | Exchange Broker      | Synchronize updates across partners and handle conflict resolution |
| Governance | Policy Orchestrator  | Rulesets, smart-contract enforcement, dashboards and audit exports |

**Integration**

* Triggers and actions via PLUMA workflows.
* Identity resolution against the UTCS registry.
* APIs for ATA/CAx systems and digital-twin sync (REST and gRPC).
* Emits `UTCS.md`, `SCHEMA.(json|yaml)`, and `POLICY.yaml` for each leaf.

**Benefits**

* ~90% reduction in manual passport creation effort.
* Shorter certification lead times via autonomous compliance checks.
* Continuous trust maintenance across hardware, software, and models.

#### Digital passports for maintainable source code modules

Software and model artifacts receive passports with UTCS manifests and QS/CB anchoring, focused on maintainability and supply-chain integrity. Scope: versioned libraries, flight/ground software, embedded firmware, ML models, MBSE packages, and simulation decks.

**Maintainability evidence captured**

* Semantic version and changelog linked to signed VCS commits (GPG/Sigstore).
* SBOM (SPDX or CycloneDX) with dependency graph, licenses, and VEX status.
* Code quality signals: static analysis, lint, complexity, test results and coverage, mutation score.
* Vulnerability scans (CVE), policy gates, and remediation SLA.
* Reproducible build attestation (SLSA / in-toto), artifact digest, and provenance metadata.
* Operational SLOs for services, deprecation policy, and end-of-life timetable.

**UTCS manifest (software) — minimal fields**

```yaml
utcs_ref: UTCS-IIS-SW/{module_id}@{semver}
repo: {vcs_provider}/{org}/{project}
path: /{subdir}
commit: {sha}

  static_analysis: {score}
  vulnerabilities: {open_critical}/{open_high}
policies:
  - {rule_id}: {status}

```

**CI/CD rules (software)**

* Block merge if SBOM or `UTCS.md` missing.
* Require signed commits and tags and Codeowners review.
* Fail if critical vulns > 0 or coverage < threshold.
* Require SLSA-level provenance and reproducible-build attestation before CB.

## Architecture and implementation

### Applied TFA path grammar, domains, and UTCS anchoring

**Path schema**

```
/ORG/{ORG_CODE}/PROGRAM/{PGM_CODE}/THREAD/{THREAD_ID}
/STATE/{QS|FWD|UE|FE|CB|QB}/LAYER/{L1|L2|L3|L4}
/DOMAIN/{AAA…PPP}/PAX/{ONB|OUT}/{PACKAGE}/{ITEM}
```

* `STATE` = QS → FWD → UE → FE → CB → QB
* `LAYER` = L1=DATA, L2=MODEL, L3=SERVICE, L4=APP
* `DOMAIN` = 15 TFA domains (AAA…PPP)
* `PAX` = ONB | OUT
* Every leaf contains `UTCS.md` `{utcs_ref, checksum, signer, ts}` and passes FCR-1/2.

**Example scaffold**

**State progression**

```
.../STATE/QS/LAYER/L2/MODEL/.../CAE/FEM/MESHES/          # pre-event

.../STATE/CB /LAYER/L1/DATA/.../TIMESERIES/LABELING/      # post-event
.../STATE/QB /LAYER/L4/APP/.../DASHBOARDS/COMPLIANCE/     # baselined
```

**Per-folder required files**
`README.md`, `SCHEMA.(json|yaml)`, `UTCS.md`, `POLICY.yaml`

**CI rules (minimal)**

* Paths must match:

```
^/ORG/[A-Z0-9_-]+/PROGRAM/[A-Z0-9-]+/THREAD/[A-Z0-9-]+/STATE/(QS|FWD|UE|FE|CB|QB)/LAYER/(L[1-4])/
DOMAIN/[A-Z]{3}/PAX/(ONB|OUT)/.*
```

* Block merges if `UTCS.md` or `README.md` missing at any new directory.
* FCR-1 runs on QS/FWD; FCR-2 on FE/CB before QB tagging.

## Frozen context management

Baselines capture certification states, requirement sets, design configurations, and manufacturing standards. Time-travel queries reconstruct historical states. QS anchoring prevents retroactive modification and logs tamper attempts with PKI audit trails.

## Repository index and search

Semantic search with aerospace terminology, multilingual support, and faceted filtering by TFA domain, CAx phase, ATA chapter, program, certification status, supplier, dates, and component type.
