# 15-ENVIRONMENT_VIBRATION

Environmental specifications for launch, on-orbit, and mission phases.

## Scope
Define vibration, acoustic, shock, thermal-vacuum, and radiation envelopes used by design and test.

## Specifications
- Launch vibration profiles (random/sine)
- Acoustic environment
- Shock loads
- Thermal-vacuum cycles
- Radiation environment (links to STA-87)

## Interfaces
- See `INTERFACE_MATRIX/15â†”21_51_53_70_72_75_97.csv`
- Central ICDs: `00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/09-INTERFACES/`

## Evidence (IEF artifacts)
- `SUBSYSTEMS/15-10_VIBE_ACOUSTIC_ENV/PLM/CAx/CAE/vibe-acoustic-envelope.ief.json`
- `SUBSYSTEMS/15-20_SHOCK_ENV/PLM/CAx/CAE/shock-spectrum.ief.json`
- `SUBSYSTEMS/15-30_THERMAL_VACUUM_ENV/PLM/CAx/CAE/thermal-cycle-profile.ief.json`
- `SUBSYSTEMS/15-40_RADIATION_ENV/PLM/CAx/DATA/radiation-fluence.ief.json`
- `SUBSYSTEMS/15-50_ENVIRONMENTAL_TEST_PLANS/PLM/CAx/CMP/test-sequence-v1.ief.json`

## Verification
Environmental test campaigns per ECSS; correlation with structural/thermal models; results stored as IEF.

## Ownership
Environment team (with 51/21 co-signoff for loads/thermal).
