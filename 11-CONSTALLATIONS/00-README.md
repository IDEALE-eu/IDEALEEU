# 11-CONSTALLATIONS

Constellation design, systems engineering, and mission definition for multi-satellite systems following ECSS standards.

## Overview

This section contains all constellation-related design, systems engineering, and mission planning work, organized according to ECSS practices and SPACE-T (STA) architecture for coordinated multi-satellite operations.

- **E)** Navigation, Time & Data Handling (ch. 31, 34, 41)
- **F)** Avionics, FSW & Databus (ch. 40, 42, 93)
- **G)** Control, Autonomy, FDIR & Health (ch. 22, 44, 45)
- **H)** ECLSS, Crew & Payload Accommodation (ch. 25, 35-38)
- **I)** Propulsion & Fluids (ch. 28, 29, 47, 60-85)
- **J)** Docking, Sampling & Robotics (ch. 58, 59)
- **K)** Environment, Safety & Space Traffic (ch. 15, 26, 86, 87, 90)
- **L)** Ground, Integration & Mission Ops (ch. 07, 10, 16, 32, 46, 92)
- **M)** Program, Compliance & Records (ch. 01, 04, 05, 11-14, 17-20, 98-99)
