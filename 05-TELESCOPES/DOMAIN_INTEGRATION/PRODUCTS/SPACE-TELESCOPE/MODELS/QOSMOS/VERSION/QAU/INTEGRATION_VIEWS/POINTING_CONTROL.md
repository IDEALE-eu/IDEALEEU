# Pointing Control Integration View

**Systems:** 32/34/42 â†” 70/71

## Overview

This integration view describes the pointing and stabilization control architecture including:
- Pointing stabilization (System 32)
- Navigation and attitude determination (System 34)
- Avionics and control (System 42)
- Optical system requirements (System 70)
- Instrument pointing requirements (System 71)

## Interface Summary

| From System | To System | Interface Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| 32-POINTING_STABILIZATION | 34-NAVIGATION_ATTITUDE | Data | Attitude feedback |
| 34-NAVIGATION_ATTITUDE | 42-AVIONICS_CONTROL | Data | Sensor data processing |
| 42-AVIONICS_CONTROL | 32-POINTING_STABILIZATION | Control | Pointing commands |
| 70-OPTICAL_SUBSYSTEMS | 32-POINTING_STABILIZATION | Requirements | Wavefront stability requirements |
| 71-INSTRUMENTS_PAYLOADS | 32-POINTING_STABILIZATION | Requirements | Instrument pointing requirements |

## Pointing Budget

TBD - To be populated during pointing analysis.
