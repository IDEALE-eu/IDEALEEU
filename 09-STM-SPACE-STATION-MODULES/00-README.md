# 09-STM-SPACE-STATION-MODULES

Space station module design, systems engineering, and mission definition following ECSS standards.

## Overview

This section contains all space station module (STM) related design, systems engineering, and mission planning work, organized according to ECSS practices and SPACE-T (STA) architecture. STM modules are pressurised elements designed for human occupation or cargo storage in space stations.
