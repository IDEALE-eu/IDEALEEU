## Evaluation Process

### Quarterly Cycle

**Month 1 (First month of quarter):**
- Week 1-2: Contributors submit self-assessments with evidence
- Week 3-4: Peer review phase (anonymous ratings)

**Month 2:**
- Week 1-2: Technical Council expert assessment
- Week 3-4: Strategic Board validation review

**Month 3:**
- Week 1-2: Contribution Evaluation Panel finalizes scores
- Week 3: Results communicated to contributors
- Week 4: 15-day appeal period begins

**Month 4 (First month of next quarter):**
- Week 1: Appeals resolved
- Week 2: Final scores published
- Week 3-4: Distribution executed (25% immediate, 75% vesting)

### Scoring Calculation

**Individual Total Score:**
```
Total = (Effort × 0.30) + (Innovation × 0.35) + (Value × 0.25) + (Fairness × 0.10)
```

**Qualification Threshold:**
- Minimum score: 60 points to receive distribution
- Scores 50-59: Probationary status, improvement plan required
- Scores <50: No distribution, mandatory coaching

**Top Performer Bonus:**
- Top 10% of contributors (scores ≥90): 1.5x multiplier
- Recognition in quarterly report
- Eligibility for innovation bonus pool

### Distribution Formula

**Quarterly Merit Pool:** 20M TT (80M TT ÷ 4 quarters)

**Individual Share:**
```
Share = (Individual Score / Sum of All Qualifying Scores) × 20M TT

If Top 10% Performer:
  Share = Share × 1.5
```

**Vesting Schedule:**
- 25% (5M TT): Immediate upon distribution
- 75% (15M TT): Vested quarterly over 12 months

**Example:**
- Contributor A: Score 92 (Top 10%)
- Contributor B: Score 78
- Contributor C: Score 65
- Total qualifying scores: 235

Contributor A share:
```
Base: (92 / 235) × 20M = 7.83M TT
With bonus: 7.83M × 1.5 = 11.74M TT
```
