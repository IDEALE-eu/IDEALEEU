## Pricing and Risk

### Listing Price Formula
```
Listing Price = Base(EBOM, build_date) × Health(SoH, hours, thermals) × Market(lead_time, demand)
```

**Components:**
- **Base:** Component cost from EBOM + depreciation
- **Health:** Condition multiplier (0.5 to 1.2)
- **Market:** Supply/demand adjustment (0.8 to 1.5)

### Lease Rate Formula
```
r = r0 + α·depr + β·failure + γ·liquidity − δ·collateral
```

**Where:**
- **r0:** Base rate
- **α·depr:** Depreciation factor
- **β·failure:** Failure risk premium
- **γ·liquidity:** Liquidity premium
- **δ·collateral:** Collateral discount

### Collateral Calculation
```
Collateral = VaR_95(usage_horizon) − insured_amount
```

**VaR_95:** Value at Risk at 95% confidence level

### Repair Quote
```
Repair Quote = parts + labor + logistics − warranty_credit
```
