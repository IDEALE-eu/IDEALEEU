## Phase Transitions and Integration

### Sequential Flow
Most components follow this sequence:
```
CAD → CAE → CAI → CAO → CAM → CAP → CAV → CMP → CAS
```

### Iterative Loops
Design optimization often requires iteration:
```
CAD → CAE → CAO → CAD (refined design)
CAM → CAV → CAM (manufacturing refinement)
```

### Parallel Activities
Some phases can occur in parallel:
```
CAD + CAE (concurrent engineering)
CAM + CAP (manufacturing planning)
CAV + CAS (documentation during testing)
```

### Phase Gates
Critical review points between phases:
- **Design Review** (CAD → CAE): Design completeness
- **Integration Review** (CAI → CAO): Interface compliance
- **Manufacturing Readiness** (CAO → CAM): Producibility
- **Test Readiness** (CAP → CAV): Test preparation
- **Certification** (CAV → CMP): Airworthiness compliance
- **Service Release** (CMP → CAS): Operational readiness

## "To Scale" Methodology

### The Scaling Challenge

Aerospace designs often start at small scale (prototypes, subscale models) before full-scale production. **Simple geometric scaling does not work** due to non-linear physics.

### Non-Linear Scaling Effects

#### Aerodynamics
- **Reynolds Number**: $Re = \frac{\rho V L}{\mu}$
  - Viscous effects don't scale linearly
  - Boundary layer behavior changes
  - Stall characteristics differ
  - Drag coefficients vary with scale

**Solution**: Use CFD at multiple scales, validate with wind tunnel data, apply correction factors

#### Structures
- **Buckling**: Critical load scales with $t^2$ (thickness squared)
- **Vibration**: Natural frequencies scale with $\sqrt{E/\rho}$ and geometry
- **Fatigue**: Stress concentration effects change with scale

**Solution**: Scale structural properties carefully, use similitude laws, validate with testing

#### Propulsion
- **Combustion**: Flame stability and mixing change with scale
- **Heat Transfer**: Surface-to-volume ratio affects cooling
- **Acoustic**: Noise scales non-linearly with size and speed

**Solution**: Subscale testing with similarity parameters, full-scale prototype validation

#### Manufacturing
- **Tolerance Stack-Up**: Absolute tolerances don't scale proportionally
- **Material Properties**: Larger parts may have different material behavior
- **Process Capability**: Process windows may be scale-dependent

**Solution**: Scale-specific manufacturing plans, process validation at each scale

### IDEALE-EU "To Scale" Approach

1. **Multi-Scale Modeling**:
   - Maintain models at all scales (prototype, subscale, full-scale)
   - Link models through scaling relationships
   - Document scaling assumptions

2. **Validation at Each Scale**:
   - Test at prototype scale
   - Validate at subscale
   - Verify at full-scale
   - QS anchor each validated configuration

3. **Scaling Traceability**:
   - Document all scaling factors
   - Link passports across scales
   - Maintain scaling rationale
   - Track validation evidence

4. **Physics-Based Corrections**:
   - Apply similarity theory (Reynolds, Froude, Mach numbers)
   - Use correction factors from test data
   - Validate corrections with full-scale testing
   - Document all corrections in passports

### Example: Hydrogen Aircraft Scaling

```
Prototype (1:10 scale):
- Reynolds Number: 10^6
- LH2 Tank: 100 liters
- Insulation thickness: 5 cm

Full-Scale:
- Reynolds Number: 10^8 (different flow regime)
- LH2 Tank: 10,000 liters
- Insulation thickness: 15 cm (not 50 cm!)
  - Heat leak scales with surface area (L^2)
  - Volume scales with L^3
  - Optimum insulation: ~L^0.7
```

**Digital Passport Linkage**:
- Prototype passport: PP-CQH-2024-001234
- Full-scale passport: PP-CQH-2025-005678
- Linked with scaling rationale document
- QS anchored validation data at both scales
