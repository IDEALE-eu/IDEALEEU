## Core Concepts

### Digital Passport
A comprehensive, tamper-proof digital record that follows an aerospace component throughout its entire lifecycle, from design through manufacturing, certification, operation, and retirement. Contains all relevant metadata, documentation, analysis results, test data, and configuration history.

### QS (Quantum Superposition)
A deterministic framework for managing aerospace component configurations. Represents multiple potential configurations existing simultaneously as candidates until selection criteria collapse them to a single optimal choice. **Note**: Not related to quantum computing; the term refers to configuration state space methodology.

### TFA (Threading Functional Architecture)
A systematic organization framework comprising 15 canonical domains (AAA through PPP) that structure aerospace lifecycle data. Provides consistent organization across design, analysis, manufacturing, and service phases.

### UTCS (UiX Threading Context/Content/Cache and Structure/Style/Sheet)
The foundational framework for evidence organization and traceability. Provides structured manifests containing component data, metadata, and cryptographic seals for tamper-proof provenance.

### PLUMA (Product Lifecycle Universal Management Architecture)
Automation framework for managing aerospace product lifecycles. Integrates CAx phases, TFA domains, and digital thread concepts into a cohesive platform with parametric documentation generation and frozen context management.

### QS Anchoring
The process of cryptographically sealing a configuration state by computing a hash (Merkle root) of the UTCS manifest. Creates an immutable snapshot that cannot be altered without detection.

### Evidence Anchoring
The broader practice of recording and cryptographically sealing evidence artifacts (CAD models, test data, analysis results) to provide tamper-proof provenance for certification and audit purposes.
