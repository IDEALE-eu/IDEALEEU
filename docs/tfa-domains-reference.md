# TFA Domains Reference

## What is TFA?

**TFA (Threading Functional Architecture)** is IDEALE-EU's structural framework that organizes aerospace lifecycle management across 15 specialized domains. Each domain manages specific aspects of the complete product lifecycle from concept to retirement.

## Architecture Flow

**QS→FWD→UE→FE→CB→QB**

- **QS** (Quantum Superposition): Pre-event state capture with multiple potential outcomes in superposition before crystallization
- **FWD** (Future/Waves Dynamics): Predictive and retrodictive modeling
- **UE** (Unit Element): Classical fundamental units
- **FE** (Federation Entanglement): Distributed multi-party coordination
- **CB** (Classical Bit): Post-event deterministic reality anchoring
- **QB** (Qubit): Quantum computation strategies

## Implementation Guidelines

### Domain Selection for Programs

Not all programs require all 15 domains. Select domains based on:

1. **Aircraft Development**: AAA, PPP, EDI, LCC, EEE, EER, MMM, LIB, IIS
2. **H2 Propulsion Programs**: CQH, PPP, EER, LIB, IIS (plus infrastructure)
3. **MRO Operations**: MMM, OOO, LIB, EDI (monitoring), IIS (analytics)
4. **Ground Operations**: AAP, IIF, OOO, LIB
5. **Space Systems**: AAA (structures), LCC (control), EDI (instruments), EEE (solar power)

### Cross-Domain Workflows

**Configuration Management**: Spans all domains with LIB as coordinator
- ECR/ECO/CCB processes touch multiple domains
- QS anchoring ensures tamper-proof change history

**Certification**: Primarily AAA, EER, LCC with support from all technical domains
- Evidence packages assembled from domain-specific data
- CSDB integration for S1000D technical publications

**Supply Chain**: LIB coordinates with all manufacturing domains
- Digital passports link components to specific domains
- Supplier integration through standardized APIs
