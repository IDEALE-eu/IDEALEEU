# Glossary and Acronyms

## Core Architecture

### QS – Quantum Superposition (Pre-Event State)

**Formal Definition**: A predictable field of pre-optimized configuration candidates held before CRITERIA collapse.

**Mathematical Formalization**:
- Candidate set: $\mathcal{Q} = \{x_i\}_{i=1}^N \subset \mathcal{X}$
- Predictive field: $s_i = f_{\text{pred}}(x_i|\mathcal{D})$ with uncertainty $\sigma_i$
- Constraints: $x_i \models \mathcal{C}_0$ (hard), $\phi_0(x_i)$ (soft)
- Collapse: $x^\star = \arg\min_{x \in \mathcal{Q}} J_{\mathcal{K}}(x)$ subject to $x \models \mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{K}}$

**Intuitive Explanation**: QS captures all possible future outcomes with probabilities BEFORE an event occurs. When the event happens (criteria enacted), the superposition "collapses" to a single reality (CB). Both the pre-event QS and post-event CB are anchored immutably, enabling predictive validation.

**See**: [QS Technical Specification](/docs/technical/qs-specification/) for complete formalization.

---

### FWD – Future/Waves Dynamics

**Definition**: Predictive and retrodictive modeling that propagates QS candidates through time, enabling nowcasting, forecasting, and "what-if" scenario analysis.

**Function in TFA Flow**:
- Receives QS field $\mathcal{Q}$ with scores and uncertainties
- Distributes candidates to stakeholders
- Performs sensitivity analysis: "If criteria $\mathcal{K}_j$ applied, then $x^\star_j$ likely"
- Outputs predictive scenarios

**Use Cases**: Route optimization, weather nowcasting, failure prediction, market forecasting

---

### UE – Unit Element

**Definition**: Classical fundamental units representing deterministic components, physics constraints, and unit-level computations.

**Function in TFA Flow**:
- Applies physics/fidelity filters to QS candidates
- Tightens bounds $[l_i, u_i]$ via classical simulation
- Prunes infeasible candidates
- Updates scores with higher-fidelity models

**Examples**: Physical components (bearings, actuators), material properties, simulation units (FEA nodes)

---

### FE – Federation Entanglement

**Definition**: Distributed multi-party coordination enforcing governance, fairness, and policy compliance across organizational boundaries.

**Function in TFA Flow**:
- Enforces governance policies
- Applies fairness constraints
- Manages multi-party consensus on criteria $\mathcal{K}$
- Entangles decisions across stakeholders

**Use Cases**: Supplier consortia, multi-airline collaborations, international programs, regulatory coordination

---

### CB – Classical Bit (Post-Event Reality)

**Definition**: Deterministic, post-event state representing actual outcomes after QS collapse. The "classical reality" that crystallizes from superposition.

**Function in TFA Flow**:
- Records collapsed state $x^\star$ after criteria $\mathcal{K}$ applied
- Anchors actual outcomes immutably
- Serves as baseline for validation against QS predictions
- Cannot be back-edited

**Relationship to QS**: 
- QS = "what could happen" (pre-event superposition)
- CB = "what did happen" (post-event reality)
- QS→CB validation = learning loop

---

### QB – Qubit (Quantum Computation)

**Definition**: Quantum computation strategies and quantum-inspired optimization algorithms applied to execute or refine solutions.

**Function in TFA Flow**:
- Computes/executes $x^\star$ (selected configuration)
- Monitors actual performance vs predicted
- Computes deltas $\Delta = s^{\text{actual}} - s^{\text{predicted}}$
- Emits feedback to improve QS models

**Technologies**: Quantum annealing, QAOA, variational algorithms, quantum simulators, quantum-inspired classical algorithms

## Standards and Compliance

### OtC – Open to Change

- Creative and adaptive approaches enabled
- Open baseline evolution before formal stabilization
- Foundation for GenSTD conversion

---

### GenSTD – Generalized Standardization Directive

- Provides CM-compliant, policy-driven baselines with embedded OtC logic
- Ensures regulatory and compliance alignment

**Hierarchy**:

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|

**Conversion Rule**: 
```
OtC[x] + CAB approval + CSA trace → GenSTD[y]
```

**Provenance**: Each GenSTD entry inherits metadata from its OtC source including hash, manifest, RFC ID, and audit references.

**Policy Statement**: "OtC remains the generative layer. GenSTD is the stabilization and dissemination layer. Compliance derives from GenSTD, adaptability from OtC."

**See Also**: OtC, EHC (Embedded in Human Comprehensivity), CAB, CSA

- **CCB** (Configuration Control Board): Governance body approving/rejecting changes

2. CCB reviews (using QS field if new design trade needed)
3. Approval → ECO issued
4. ECO implementation → CB anchor updates
5. Complete audit trail QS-anchored

---

## Operational Terms

### Freeze (QS Context)

**Definition**: Immutable snapshot of QS field at decision boundary. After freeze, no candidates can be added/removed/modified.

**Mechanism**: Compute Merkle root $H = \mathsf{Merkle}(\{h_i\})$ and timestamp

**Purpose**: Prevents post-hoc rationalization; ensures decision made against known option set

---

### Collapse (QS Context)

**Definition**: Application of decision criteria $\mathcal{K}$ to select $x^\star$ from frozen QS field $\mathcal{Q}$.

**Process**:
1. QS field frozen (Merkle root $H$ computed)
2. Criteria $\mathcal{K}$ enacted by decision authority
3. Objective $J_{\mathcal{K}}(x)$ evaluated for all candidates
4. Optimal $x^\star$ selected
5. Collapse recorded with $(\mathcal{K}, x^\star, H, t)$
6. $x^\star$ becomes CB baseline going forward

**Irreversible**: Cannot undo collapse; can only create new QS field (versioned $QS_{k+1}$)

---

### Merkle Root

**Definition**: Cryptographic hash computed from tree of hashes, enabling efficient verification of data integrity.

**Use in IDEALE-EU**:
- QS field: $H = \mathsf{Merkle}(\{h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_N\})$ where $h_i$ is hash of candidate $x_i$
- Any tampering with candidate invalidates $H$
- Provides cryptographic proof QS field unchanged since freeze

**Properties**: 
- Small size (256 bits) regardless of $N$
- Efficient verification ($O(\log N)$)
- Tamper-evident

---

### Delta (QS→CB Validation)

**Definition**: Difference between QS-predicted performance and CB-actual performance after implementation.

**Formula**: $\Delta = s^{\text{actual}} - s^{\text{predicted}}$

**Use Cases**:
- Model validation: Small $\Delta$ → good predictions
- Learning: Use $(x, s^{\text{pred}}, s^{\text{actual}}, \Delta)$ to improve $f_{\text{pred}}$
- Regret analysis: $\Delta > 0$ → actual better than predicted (lucky); $\Delta < 0$ → worse (regret)
