# DASHBOARD_SPECS

Dashboard and visualization specifications for fleet-wide metrics and analytics.

## Overview

This directory contains specifications for dashboards that provide visibility into fleet operations, performance, and health across both aircraft and spacecraft platforms.

## Dashboard Categories

### Program Metrics
- Requirements coverage (target: â‰¥ 99%)
- Defect escape rates
- Schedule variance tracking
- Cost tracking

### Operational Metrics
- Fleet availability
- Dispatch reliability
- Mission success rates
- System health indicators

### Engineering Metrics
- Mass/weight margins
- Performance parameters
- Verification status
- Quality indicators

## Dashboard Specifications

Each dashboard specification should include:
- **Purpose** - What the dashboard measures and why
- **Audience** - Who uses this dashboard
- **Data Sources** - Where the data comes from
- **Refresh Rate** - How often data is updated
- **Key Metrics** - Primary KPIs displayed
- **Visualizations** - Charts, graphs, and display types
- **Alerts** - Threshold-based notifications
