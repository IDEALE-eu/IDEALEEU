# ANALYTICS_AND_AI

Fleet-wide analytics and AI capabilities supporting operational optimization and decision-making.

## Overview

This directory provides centralized analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities for fleet operations, serving both aircraft and spacecraft operational data. It consolidates AI/ML models, optimization algorithms, and dashboards for decision support across the entire fleet.

## Contents

- **00-README.md** - This file
- **[DASHBOARD_SPECS/](DASHBOARD_SPECS/)** - Dashboard and visualization specifications for fleet metrics

## Purpose

This structure provides:
- Unified analytics capabilities across aircraft and spacecraft
- Dashboard specifications for fleet-wide metrics
- Integration point for AI/ML models from various fleet subsystems
- Centralized visualization and reporting standards

## Fleet Metrics Dashboards

Dashboard specifications cover:
- Requirements coverage metrics (â‰¥ 99%)
- Defect escape tracking
- Mass/weight margins monitoring
- Schedule variance tracking
- Unit cost monitoring
- Dispatch/mission success rates
