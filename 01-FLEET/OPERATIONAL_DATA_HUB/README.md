# OPERATIONAL_DATA_HUB

Centralized hub for collecting, storing, processing, and distributing operational data from aircraft and spacecraft fleets.

## Purpose

The Operational Data Hub serves as the single source of truth for fleet telemetry, performance metrics, and operational events. It provides data infrastructure for:

- **Predictive Maintenance** - Early fault detection and RUL (Remaining Useful Life) estimation
- **Digital Twin Retraining** - Real-world data feedback for model calibration
- **Federated Learning** - Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning
- **Regulatory Compliance** - Audit trails, data retention, and reporting
- **Fleet Analytics** - Performance benchmarking and reliability analysis

## Architecture Overview

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Immutable Raw Data
- All ingested telemetry stored in append-only raw vault
- No deletions (except for legal/regulatory requirements)
- Complete lineage tracking from source to consumption

### 2. Schema-First Engineering
- All data sources registered in Schema Registry
- Semantic versioning for schema evolution (SemVer)
- Backward/forward compatibility policies enforced

### 3. Data Quality by Design
- Validation at ingestion (range checks, completeness)
- Anomaly detection before storage
- Data quality metrics tracked per dataset

### 4. Privacy and Security
- Classification schema (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- PII anonymization and GDPR compliance
- ITAR/EAR export control screening

### 5. Data Contracts
- Explicit contracts between producers and consumers
- SLA guarantees (latency, freshness, quality)
- Versioned and PR-reviewed

## Integration Points

### Upstream Sources
- **Aircraft Telemetry**: FDR/QAR data, H2 systems monitoring, avionics health
- **Spacecraft Telemetry**: Orbital state, power/thermal, propulsion, payload operations
- **Ground Systems**: Maintenance events, flight planning, weather data

### Downstream Consumers
- **Predictive Maintenance** → `../MRO_STRATEGY/04-PREDICTIVE_MAINTENANCE/`
- **Federated Learning** → `../FEDERATED_LEARNING/`
- **Digital Twin** → `../../00-PROGRAM/DIGITAL_THREAD/05-DIGITAL_TWIN/`
- **Configuration Management** → `../../00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/`
- **Quality Management** → `../../00-PROGRAM/QUALITY_QMS/`

## Data Flow

### Real-Time Streaming
1. Telemetry published to topics (e.g., `fl.acft.h2.pressure.v1`)
2. Schema validation at ingestion
3. Anomaly detection (statistical + ML)
4. Routing to raw vault and real-time consumers

### Batch Processing
1. Historical data uploaded via API/SFTP
2. Data quality checks (completeness, range, consistency)
3. Partitioning by date, platform, system
4. Catalog update in Metadata Registry

### Data Product Creation
1. Curated datasets derived from raw vault
2. Feature engineering and aggregation
3. Quality assessment and documentation
4. Publication with data contract

## Governance

### Roles and Responsibilities
- **Data Owner**: Flight Operations, Mission Operations
- **Data Steward**: Data Engineering Team
- **Data Consumer**: AI/ML Team, MRO Team, Design Engineering
- **Approver**: Configuration Control Board (CCB)

### Change Management
- Schema changes require Engineering Change Request (ECR)
- Breaking changes require impact assessment
- Consumer notification before deprecation (90 days minimum)

3. Implement schema validation in your pipeline
4. Test ingestion with sample data

### For Data Consumers
1. Browse available data products in `05-DATA_PRODUCTS/`
2. Review data contract for your use case
3. Request access via RBAC matrix
4. Integrate using API gateway specs in `07-INTEGRATIONS/`
