# 03-CLIENTS

Federated learning client implementations for aircraft edge devices, ground stations, and simulation rigs.

## Purpose

This directory contains client-side FL implementations, runtime constraints, sandboxing policies, and diagnostic procedures for each client type.

## Contents

- [**GROUND_STATIONS/**](GROUND_STATIONS/) -  Ground station FL clients
- [**SIM_RIGS/**](SIM_RIGS/) -  Simulation rig FL clients

## Client Architecture

### Common Components

All FL clients implement:
1. **Local training**: Train models on local data
2. **Model updates**: Compute gradients or weight deltas
3. **Communication**: Upload updates, download global models
4. **Health monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk, network diagnostics
5. **Security**: Encryption, authentication, sandboxing

### Client-Specific Adaptations

- **Aircraft**: Resource-constrained, intermittent connectivity, safety-critical isolation
- **Ground Stations**: High compute, continuous connectivity, full dataset access
- **Simulation Rigs**: Very high compute, synthetic data, on-demand training
