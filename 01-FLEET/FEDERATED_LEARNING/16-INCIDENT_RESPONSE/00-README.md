# 16-INCIDENT_RESPONSE

Incident response procedures, postmortems, and audit logs for FL systems.

## Purpose

Define incident detection, containment, communication, and rollback procedures for FL security or safety incidents.

- [**RUNBOOK.md**](RUNBOOK.md) - Incident response runbook (Detection → Containment → Comms → Rollback)
- [**POSTMORTEMS/**](POSTMORTEMS/) -  Blameless postmortems (action-oriented)
- [**AUDIT_LOGS/**](AUDIT_LOGS/) -  Immutable, signed logs for regulators

## Incident Types

### Security Incidents

- Byzantine client attack (malicious gradients)
- Unauthorized access to aggregation server
- Data breach (telemetry exfiltration)

### Safety Incidents

- FL model interfering with flight-critical systems
- Model drift causing incorrect predictions
- Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk)

### Operational Incidents

- Aggregation server failure
- Network partition (client-server disconnection)
- Training round failure (insufficient participation)

## Incident Response Workflow

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring, manual report
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems, rollback model
3. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders (PagerDuty, Slack, Email)
4. **Rollback**: Revert to previous model version
5. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
6. **Postmortem**: Blameless postmortem, lessons learned
