# FEDERATED_LEARNING

Federated learning infrastructure for collaborative model training across distributed aircraft fleet, ground stations, and simulation environments while maintaining data sovereignty and privacy.

## Scope

This directory contains the complete federated learning (FL) system architecture, policies, and operational procedures for the IDEALE program. The FL infrastructure enables:

- **Cross-silo learning** between aircraft, ground stations, and simulation rigs
- **Data sovereignty** with local training and aggregated global models
- **Privacy-preserving** model updates using differential privacy and secure aggregation
- **Safety-critical compliance** with aviation (DO-178C, DO-326A) and space (ECSS) standards
- **Scalable orchestration** across LEO/GEO satellite connectivity profiles

## Safety-of-Flight Boundaries

⚠️ **CRITICAL SAFETY CONSTRAINTS:**

1. **NO autotuning on flight-critical systems** - FL models are advisory only
2. **Sandboxed execution** - ARINC 653/IMA partitioning enforced
3. **Human-in-the-loop** - All model deployments require CCB approval
4. **Rollback capability** - Immediate reversion on drift detection or safety alerts
5. **Resource constraints** - CPU%, power, and thermal limits strictly enforced

## Data Sovereignty & Ownership

- **Aircraft data**: Remains on aircraft; only gradients/weights shared
- **Ground stations**: Full dataset access with aggregation authority
- **Simulation rigs**: Non-flight data for validation and testing
- **Model ownership**: AI/ML Team with CCB oversight
- **GDPR compliance**: Pseudonymisation, consent, and retention policies (see 05-PRIVACY_SECURITY/)

## Quick Start

1. **Architecture**: Review [01-ARCHITECTURE/FL_TOPOLOGY.md](01-ARCHITECTURE/FL_TOPOLOGY.md) for system design
2. **Deployment**: Check [09-DEPLOYMENT/ROLLOUT_STRATEGY.md](09-DEPLOYMENT/ROLLOUT_STRATEGY.md) for deployment procedures
3. **Compliance**: Read [11-COMPLIANCE/AVIATION.md](11-COMPLIANCE/AVIATION.md) for certification requirements
4. **Templates**: Use [15-TEMPLATES/](15-TEMPLATES/) for standard documents

## Responsibilities

- **AI/ML Team**: Model development, training orchestration, performance monitoring
- **Fleet Operations**: Client health, connectivity, data quality
- **Safety Engineering**: Safety gates, certification evidence, risk assessment
- **Configuration Management**: Baseline control, CCB approval, release management
- **DPO (Data Protection Officer)**: Privacy compliance, GDPR alignment
