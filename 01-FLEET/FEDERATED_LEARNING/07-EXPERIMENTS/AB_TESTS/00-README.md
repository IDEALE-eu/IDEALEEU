# AB_TESTS

A/B testing specifications for FL algorithm and hyperparameter evaluation.

## Purpose

Rigorously evaluate FL algorithms, hyperparameters, and model architectures through controlled A/B tests.

## Test Design

- **Treatment**: New FL algorithm (e.g., FedProx)
- **Control**: Baseline algorithm (e.g., FedAvg)
- **Metrics**: Convergence speed, model accuracy, communication cost
- **Duration**: 4-8 weeks (sufficient FL rounds)
- **Statistical power**: 80% (detect 5% improvement)
