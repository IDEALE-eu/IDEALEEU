# SPACE

Space compliance: ECSS-Q-ST-80, ECSS-E-ST-40.

## ECSS-Q-ST-80 (Software Product Assurance)

### Scope

If FL deployed on spacecraft or satellite systems:

- **Software class**: Class C (recommended for non-critical advisory systems)
- **Verification**: Requirements verification, code reviews, testing
- **Configuration management**: Baseline control, version tracking

### Evidence

- Requirements traceability
- Test results
- Configuration status accounting (CSA)

## ECSS-E-ST-40 (Software Engineering)

### Software Lifecycle

- Requirements → Design → Implementation → Verification → Operation
- Aligned with ../../08-VALIDATION_VVP/TEST_PLANS.md

## Applicability

**Current status**: TBD (depends on spacecraft FL deployment)
