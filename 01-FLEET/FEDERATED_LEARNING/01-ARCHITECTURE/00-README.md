# 01-ARCHITECTURE

Federated learning system architecture, topology design, and data contracts.

## Purpose

This directory defines the architectural design of the federated learning infrastructure, including network topology, client types, communication patterns, and data schemas.

## Contents

- [**00-README.md**](00-README.md) - This file
- [**FL_TOPOLOGY.md**](FL_TOPOLOGY.md) - Network topology (star vs. hierarchical), cross-silo communication
- [**CLIENT_TYPES.md**](CLIENT_TYPES.md) - Aircraft edge devices, ground stations, simulation rigs with certification status
- [**DATA_CONTRACTS/**](DATA_CONTRACTS/) -  Telemetry schemas, label definitions, and data formats

## Architecture Principles

### Design Goals
1. **Scalability** - Support 100+ aircraft, multiple ground stations, and simulation environments
2. **Resilience** - Tolerate intermittent connectivity (LEO/GEO satellite windows)
3. **Security** - Encrypted communication, authenticated clients, secure aggregation
4. **Efficiency** - Minimize bandwidth usage through compression and gradient quantization
5. **Compliance** - Meet aviation (DO-178C) and space (ECSS) certification requirements

### Key Decisions
- **Topology**: Star architecture with central aggregation server (scalable to hierarchical)
- **Communication**: Asynchronous training rounds with scheduled SATCOM windows
- **Data residency**: Training data remains local; only model updates transmitted
- **Client heterogeneity**: Support for varying compute capabilities and data distributions

## Integration Points

### Upstream Dependencies
- [**00-PROGRAM/DIGITAL_THREAD/**](00-PROGRAM/DIGITAL_THREAD/) -  UTCS anchors, graph IDs for traceability
- [**01-FLEET/OPERATIONAL_DATA_HUB/**](01-FLEET/OPERATIONAL_DATA_HUB/) -  Fleet telemetry data sources
- [**02-AIRCRAFT/DOMAIN_INTEGRATION/INFO_COMM_AVIONICS/**](02-AIRCRAFT/DOMAIN_INTEGRATION/INFO_COMM_AVIONICS/) -  Avionics data interfaces

### Downstream Consumers
- [**02-ORCHESTRATION/**](02-ORCHESTRATION/) -  Uses topology for client selection and scheduling
- [**03-CLIENTS/**](03-CLIENTS/) -  Implements client-side architecture patterns
- [**05-PRIVACY_SECURITY/**](05-PRIVACY_SECURITY/) -  Applies security controls to communication channels

## Architecture Review Process

1. **Proposal** - Architecture change request submitted to AI/ML Team
2. **Impact Analysis** - Assess effects on performance, security, compliance
3. **Peer Review** - Technical review by system architects
4. **CCB Approval** - Configuration Control Board approval for baseline changes
5. **Implementation** - Phased rollout with canary testing
