## Overview

Modern MRO operations face cybersecurity challenges:
- **Data Sensitivity**: Maintenance records contain competitive and safety-critical information
- **Connected Systems**: Aircraft/spacecraft telemetry, digital twins, predictive analytics
- **Supply Chain**: Third-party access to systems and data
- **Regulatory**: GDPR, cybersecurity directives, export control

## Data Security

### Data Classification
- **Public**: Press releases, marketing materials
- **Internal**: General business information
- **Confidential**: Customer contracts, pricing, proprietary methods
- **Restricted**: Safety-critical data, personally identifiable information (PII)
- **Secret**: Export-controlled technical data (ITAR, EAR)

### Protection Measures
- **Encryption**: At-rest (AES-256) and in-transit (TLS 1.3)
- **Access Control**: Role-based (RBAC), need-to-know principle
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor (MFA), single sign-on (SSO)
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive access and modification trails
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Monitoring and blocking unauthorized transfers

### Data Governance
- **Data Ownership**: Clear responsibility for each data type
- **Retention Policies**: Regulatory and business requirements
- **Disposal**: Secure deletion when no longer needed
- **Privacy**: GDPR, CCPA compliance for personal data
- **Export Control**: ITAR, EAR compliance for technical data

See [**MRO_DATA_SECURITY.md**](MRO_DATA_SECURITY.md) for detailed policies.

## Connected MRO Risks

### Attack Vectors
- **Aircraft Data Link**: ACARS, ADS-B, satellite communications
- **Ground Systems**: Maintenance laptops, diagnostic equipment
- **Network Infrastructure**: WiFi, Ethernet, Internet connectivity
- **Supply Chain**: Software updates, third-party components
- **Social Engineering**: Phishing, insider threats

### Threat Scenarios
- **Data Theft**: Competitive intelligence, flight operations, passenger data
- **Sabotage**: Malicious software affecting aircraft systems
- **Ransomware**: Operational disruption through data encryption
- **Denial of Service**: Preventing access to critical systems
- **Supply Chain Compromise**: Trojanized components or software

### Risk Mitigation
- **Segmentation**: Isolated networks for safety-critical systems
- **Monitoring**: Intrusion detection systems (IDS), security information and event management (SIEM)
- **Incident Response**: Playbooks for cyber incidents
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular patching and penetration testing
- **Security by Design**: Secure development lifecycle (SDL)

See [**CONNECTED_MRO_RISK.md**](CONNECTED_MRO_RISK.md) for risk assessment framework.

- **Change Control**: Authorization and documentation
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to restore previous version

### Remote Access
- **VPN**: Encrypted tunnels for remote maintenance
- **Jump Hosts**: Controlled access points (bastion hosts)
- **Session Recording**: Audit trail of remote activities
- **Time-Limited**: Automatic session termination
- **Two-Person Rule**: Approval and monitoring for critical systems

### Third-Party Access
- **Vetting**: Background checks, security training
