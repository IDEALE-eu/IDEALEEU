## Overview

Predictive maintenance represents a paradigm shift from reactive (break-fix) and preventive (time-based) to proactive (condition-based) maintenance strategies:

### Traditional Maintenance
- **Reactive**: Fix after failure (unscheduled, costly, safety risk)
- **Preventive**: Time/cycle-based intervals (over-maintenance, waste)

### Predictive Maintenance
- **Condition-Based**: Maintain when condition requires it
- **Prognostic**: Predict remaining useful life (RUL)
- **Prescriptive**: Optimize maintenance timing and resources

## Digital Twin Architecture

### Physical Asset
- Aircraft/spacecraft with embedded sensors
- Real-time telemetry streaming
- Operational history and maintenance records

### Digital Model
- High-fidelity virtual representation
