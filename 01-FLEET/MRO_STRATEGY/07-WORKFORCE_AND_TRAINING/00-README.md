- **Training Aircraft**: Out-of-service aircraft for hands-on practice
- **On-the-Job (OJT)**: Supervised work on operational fleet
- **Peer Review**: Buddy system for complex tasks

### Computer-Based Training (CBT)
- **Self-Paced**: Accessible anytime, anywhere
- **Interactive**: Simulations, branching scenarios
- **Assessment**: Knowledge checks and final exams
- **Tracking**: Learning management system (LMS)

### Simulation and VR/AR
- **Full Flight Simulators**: For pilots and engineers
- **Maintenance Trainers**: Task-specific simulators (landing gear, APU)
- **Virtual Reality**: Immersive 3D environment for procedures
- **Augmented Reality**: Overlay instructions on actual hardware
- **Digital Twin**: Practice on virtual representation before physical work
