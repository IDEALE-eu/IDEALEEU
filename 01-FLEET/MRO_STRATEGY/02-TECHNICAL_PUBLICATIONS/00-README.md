# 02-TECHNICAL_PUBLICATIONS

IETM strategy, master document list, and publication lifecycle management.

## Purpose

Manage technical documentation throughout its lifecycle, from creation through revision control to archival, ensuring maintainers have access to current, accurate information.

## Contents

- [**00-README.md**](00-README.md) - This file
- [**IETM_STRATEGY.md**](IETM_STRATEGY.md) - Interactive Electronic Technical Manual implementation
- [**MASTER_DOCUMENT_LIST.csv**](MASTER_DOCUMENT_LIST.csv) - Comprehensive catalog of all MRO publications
- [**PUBLICATION_LIFECYCLE.md**](PUBLICATION_LIFECYCLE.md) - Document creation, revision, approval, and archival process

## Overview

Technical publications provide the authoritative maintenance instructions, ensuring:
- **Accuracy**: Single source of truth for maintenance procedures
- **Currency**: Timely updates for service bulletins and regulatory changes
- **Accessibility**: Digital delivery to maintenance locations worldwide
- **Traceability**: Revision history and effectivity tracking

## Publication Types

### Maintenance Manuals
- **AMM** (Aircraft Maintenance Manual): System descriptions and maintenance procedures
- **IPC** (Illustrated Parts Catalog): Part identification and ordering information
- **WDM** (Wiring Diagram Manual): Electrical system schematics
- **SRM** (Structural Repair Manual): Damage assessment and repair procedures
- **TSM** (Troubleshooting Manual): Fault isolation and diagnostic procedures

### Spacecraft Documentation
- **Mission Operations Handbook**: On-orbit procedures and anomaly response
- **Ground Segment Manuals**: Ground station operations and maintenance
- **Spacecraft Maintenance Manual**: Pre-launch and post-mission servicing

### Operational Documents
- **MPD** (Maintenance Planning Document): Task intervals and requirements
- **Service Bulletins**: OEM-recommended improvements
- **Airworthiness Directives**: Mandatory regulatory actions
- **Engineering Orders**: Operator-specific modifications

## IETM Implementation

### S1000D Standard
- **Data Modules**: Modular, reusable content units
- **Common Source Database**: Single-source, multi-channel publishing
- **Interactive Features**: Hyperlinks, animations, 3D models
- **Dynamic Content**: Context-sensitive information display

### Delivery Platforms
- **Tablet Applications**: Mobile access for line maintenance
- **Hangar Workstations**: Large-screen interactive display
- **Augmented Reality**: AR overlays for complex procedures
- **Offline Mode**: Cached content for remote locations

## Integration Points

### Configuration Management
- Publication baselines tracked in [**../../../00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/**](../../../00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/)
- Engineering change orders update technical publications
- Effectivity tied to aircraft/spacecraft serial numbers
- See [**../08-INTEGRATIONS/CONFIG_MGMT_FEEDBACK.md**](../08-INTEGRATIONS/CONFIG_MGMT_FEEDBACK.md)

### Digital Thread
- Publication revisions linked to design changes in [**../../../00-PROGRAM/DIGITAL_THREAD/**](../../../00-PROGRAM/DIGITAL_THREAD/)
- UTCS anchors for traceability to requirements and design
- See [**../08-INTEGRATIONS/DIGITAL_THREAD_HOOKS.md**](../08-INTEGRATIONS/DIGITAL_THREAD_HOOKS.md)

### Maintenance Program
- MPD tasks reference specific manual procedures
- Task cards generated from publication content
- See [**../03-MAINTENANCE_PROGRAM/**](../03-MAINTENANCE_PROGRAM/)

### Quality System
- Document control procedures in [**../../../00-PROGRAM/QUALITY_QMS/**](../../../00-PROGRAM/QUALITY_QMS/)
- Publication audit trails for compliance
- See [**../06-QUALITY_AND_COMPLIANCE/**](../06-QUALITY_AND_COMPLIANCE/)

## Publication Lifecycle

### Creation Phase
1. **Authoring**: Technical writers create initial content
2. **SME Review**: Subject matter experts validate accuracy
3. **Illustration**: Graphics, diagrams, and 3D models developed
4. **Translation**: Localization for global operations

### Approval Phase
1. **Engineering Review**: Design authority validates procedures
2. **Regulatory Review**: Certification authority approval where required
3. **Quality Check**: Format, style, and completeness verification
4. **Release**: Publication assigned revision and issued

### Maintenance Phase
1. **Change Requests**: Service bulletins, ADs, operator feedback
2. **Impact Analysis**: Determine affected publications
3. **Revision**: Update content with change tracking
4. **Re-approval**: Expedited process for minor changes

### Archival Phase
1. **Superseded Versions**: Maintain historical record
2. **Retention Period**: Regulatory and legal requirements
3. **Retrieval**: Access to previous revisions for investigation

## Master Document List

[**MASTER_DOCUMENT_LIST.csv**](MASTER_DOCUMENT_LIST.csv) contains:
- Document number and title
- Current revision and date
- Effectivity (aircraft/spacecraft series)
- Owner (department/author)
- Next review date
- Distribution list

## Metrics

Publication quality metrics tracked in [**../11-METRICS_AND_KPIs/**](../11-METRICS_AND_KPIs/):
- Publication accuracy (error reports per 1000 maintenance actions)
- Update timeliness (days from change approval to publication)
- User satisfaction (survey ratings from maintainers)
- Access statistics (most-used documents, search effectiveness)
