# IETM_STRATEGY

Interactive Electronic Technical Manual implementation strategy and S1000D standards compliance.

## Purpose

Define the approach for implementing Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM) to replace or supplement paper-based maintenance documentation, improving accessibility, accuracy, and efficiency of technical information delivery.

## Overview

IETMs provide:
- **Interactive Navigation**: Hyperlinked content, search, and filters
- **Rich Media**: 3D models, animations, videos, and AR overlays
- **Context-Sensitive**: Information tailored to specific aircraft/task
- **Real-Time Updates**: Instant distribution of revisions
- **Analytics**: Usage tracking and feedback collection

## S1000D Standard

### What is S1000D?
**Definition**: International specification for technical publications
**Developed by**: ASD (AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe)
**Purpose**: Common standard for creating, managing, and delivering technical documentation

**Benefits**:
- Common Source Database (CSDB) for single-source, multi-channel publishing
- Modular content (data modules) for reuse and consistency
- Vendor-neutral XML format
- Simplified data exchange between organizations

### Key Concepts

**Data Module (DM)**:
- Smallest self-contained unit of information
- Covers single task or topic
- Identified by Data Module Code (DMC)
- Example DMC: `DMC-AIRBUSA320-27-31-11-01A-520A-A`

**Information Sets**:
- Publication modules (PM): Table of contents, title page
- Data modules: Technical content
- Applicability: What aircraft/config each DM applies to
- Metadata: Classification, security, status

**Common Information Repositories**:
- Multimedia objects (graphics, 3D, video)
- Standard numbering systems (SNS)
- Warnings, cautions, notes library
- Parts catalogs

## IETM Classifications

### IETM Class Levels
**Class 0**: Paper-based manual (not an IETM)
**Class 1**: Electronic scan of paper (PDF of manual)
**Class 2**: Scrolling electronic document with hyperlinks
**Class 3**: Hierarchically structured with interactive features
**Class 4**: Integrated with expert/diagnostic systems
**Class 5**: Integrated with automated maintenance systems

**Target for MRO**: Class 3-4 IETMs

### IETM Class 4 Features
- **Navigation**: Hyperlinked TOC, breadcrumbs, related topics
- **Search**: Full-text, filtered by applicability
- **Interactivity**: Expandable figures, hotspots, layer control
- **Integration**: Links to parts catalog, maintenance records
- **Diagnostics**: Fault isolation and troubleshooting logic
- **Feedback**: User comments and error reporting

## Implementation Architecture

**Manual Authoring**:
- Rewrite content in S1000D structure
- Higher quality but more time-consuming
- Required for complex interactive content

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Automated conversion for stable content
