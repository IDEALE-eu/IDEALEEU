## Pricing Models

### Time and Material (T&M)
**Structure**: Hourly labor rate + parts at cost + markup
**Advantages**:
- Simple and transparent
- Flexible for unknown scope
- Customer pays actual costs

**Disadvantages**:
- Cost uncertainty for customer
- No incentive for efficiency
- Administrative burden (timesheets, receipts)

**Typical Use**: AOG events, ad-hoc repairs, small operators

**Pricing**:
```
Total Cost = (Labor Hours × Hourly Rate) + (Parts Cost × Markup %)
Hourly Rate = $75-150 (mechanic) to $200-300 (engineer)
Parts Markup = 10-25%
```

### Fixed Price per Event
**Structure**: Predetermined price for specific maintenance event
**Advantages**:
- Cost certainty for customer
- Incentive for provider efficiency
- Simplified invoicing

**Disadvantages**:
- Risk of unforeseen work for provider
- Requires accurate scope definition
- Disputes over scope changes

**Typical Use**: Scheduled checks (A, B, C-checks), known modifications

**Pricing**:
```
C-Check Price = $800K - $1.5M (narrowbody aircraft)
Factors: Aircraft type, age, configuration, scope
```

### Power by the Hour (PBH)
**Structure**: Fixed rate per flight hour or cycle
**Advantages**:
- Fully predictable costs for customer
- Revenue linked to aircraft utilization
- Comprehensive coverage (parts, labor, management)

**Disadvantages**:
- Complex risk modeling for provider
- Long-term commitment (5-10 years)
- Working capital intensive (parts inventory)

**Typical Use**: Engines, landing gear, APU programs for airlines

**Pricing**:
```
PBH Rate = $250-450 per flight hour (engine, narrowbody)
Covers: All scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, parts, labor
```

### Flat Rate Programs
**Structure**: Annual fixed fee for defined maintenance scope
**Advantages**:
- Budget certainty (fixed annual cost)
- Simplifies financial planning
- Includes management and coordination

**Disadvantages**:
- Risk transfer to provider
- May incentivize minimum compliance
- Requires accurate utilization forecast

**Typical Use**: Complete maintenance programs for smaller fleets

**Pricing**:
```
Annual Fee = $12M - $18M per aircraft (full maintenance coverage)
Assumptions: 3,000 flight hours/year, typical utilization
```

### Hybrid Models
**Structure**: Combination of fixed and variable elements
**Example**: Base price + parts pass-through + performance incentives

**Advantages**:
- Risk sharing between parties
- Flexibility for different cost categories
- Alignment of incentives

**Typical Use**: Long-term strategic partnerships

## Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

### Performance Metrics
**Availability**:
- Aircraft Availability: >95%
- Component Exchange Turnaround: <24 hours
- Parts Availability: >90% fill rate

**Quality**:

### SLA Structure
**Definition**: Measurable commitments for service delivery
**Measurement**: Monthly reporting with evidence
**Incentives**: Bonuses for exceeding targets
**Penalties**: Service credits for missing targets

**Example SLA Table**:
```
Metric              Target    Bonus     Penalty
----------------------------------------------------
Aircraft Avail      >95%      +$10K     -$25K per %
C-Check TAT         <22 days  +$5K/day  -$10K/day
AOG Response        <4 hrs    +$2K      -$5K per event
Defect Rate         <0.5/K    +$15K     -$20K per 0.1
```

### SLA Exclusions
**Force Majeure**: Natural disasters, pandemics, strikes, war
**Customer-Caused**: Delayed parts approval, deferred maintenance
**Regulatory**: Authority-mandated groundings or inspections
**Design Issues**: Manufacturer defects requiring fleet-wide action

## Contract Structures

### Short-Term Agreements
**Duration**: Event-by-event or annual
**Structure**: T&M or fixed price per event
**Advantages**: Flexibility, no long-term commitment
**Use Case**: Small operators, new relationships, uncertain volume

### Long-Term Service Agreements (LTSA)
**Duration**: 5-12 years
**Structure**: Flat rate, PBH, or comprehensive coverage
**Advantages**: Cost predictability, strategic partnership, efficiency gains
**Use Case**: Large fleets, mature operators, engine/component programs

### Master Service Agreements (MSA)
**Duration**: Framework for multiple work orders
**Structure**: Pre-agreed rates and terms, work authorized case-by-case
**Advantages**: Reduces contracting overhead, maintains flexibility
**Use Case**: Ongoing relationship with variable workload

## Cost Structure

### Fixed Costs (60-70% typical)
- **Facilities**: Hangar lease/depreciation, utilities
- **Equipment**: Tooling, GSE, test equipment depreciation
- **Personnel**: Salaries for permanent staff
- **Overhead**: Management, quality, IT, HR
- **Certifications**: Regulatory approvals maintenance

### Variable Costs (30-40% typical)
- **Materials**: Parts, consumables, fluids
- **Contract Labor**: Temporary staff for peak periods
- **Freight**: Expedited shipping, AOG parts
- **Subcontracting**: Specialized work sent to third parties
- **Travel**: Technician deployment to remote sites

### Break-Even Analysis
```
Break-Even Utilization = Fixed Costs / (Revenue per Hour - Variable Cost per Hour)

Example:
Fixed Costs = $10M/year
Revenue = $200/hour
Variable Cost = $80/hour
Break-Even = $10M / ($200 - $80) = 83,333 hours/year

For 2 bays, 2 shifts: 83,333 / (2 × 2 × 2,000) = 10.4 hours/day/bay
```
