# MRO_NETWORK_STRATEGY

Geographic distribution, facility capabilities, and partnership models for MRO operations.

## Purpose

Define the optimal geographic distribution of maintenance facilities, capacity planning, and strategic partnerships to support fleet operations efficiently and cost-effectively.

## Overview

The MRO network strategy determines where, how, and by whom maintenance is performed:
- **Geographic Coverage**: Facility locations relative to operational bases
- **Capability Distribution**: Line, base, component overhaul facility placement
- **Capacity Planning**: Throughput and workforce sizing
- **Make-vs-Buy**: Internal capability vs. third-party provider decisions
- **Partnerships**: Strategic alliances and joint ventures

## Network Models

### Hub-and-Spoke Model
- **Hub Facilities**: Major base maintenance centers with full capabilities
- **Spoke Facilities**: Line maintenance stations at operational bases
- **Advantages**: Economies of scale, specialized expertise concentration
- **Challenges**: Aircraft ferry costs, logistics complexity

### Distributed Model
- **Regional Centers**: Multiple mid-sized facilities across operating region
- **Capabilities**: Each facility can perform most maintenance types
- **Advantages**: Reduced ferry costs, faster response times
- **Challenges**: Equipment/tooling duplication, workforce distribution

### Hybrid Model
- **Primary Hub**: Heavy maintenance and specialized work
- **Regional Bases**: Routine scheduled maintenance
- **Line Stations**: Daily servicing and minor repairs
- **Third-Party**: Overflow and specialized capabilities
- **Advantages**: Balanced cost and responsiveness
- **Challenges**: Complex coordination and quality control

## Facility Types

### Line Maintenance
**Location**: Co-located with operational bases
**Capabilities**:
- Daily/weekly checks (A-checks for aircraft)
- Pre-flight and post-flight inspections
- Minor defect rectification
- AOG support and troubleshooting
- Consumable servicing (oil, hydraulic fluid)

**Staffing**: 5-10 mechanics per operational base
**Equipment**: Basic tools, mobile units, ground power

### Base Maintenance
**Location**: Centralized facilities (1-3 per fleet)
**Capabilities**:
- Heavy checks (C/D-checks for aircraft)
- Structural inspections and repairs
- System overhauls and modifications
- Component removal and installation
- Paint and interior refurbishment

**Staffing**: 50-200 mechanics per facility
**Equipment**: Hangars, jigs, test equipment, paint booths

### Component Overhaul
**Location**: Specialized shops (may be co-located with base)
**Capabilities**:
- Avionics bench repair
- Hydraulic/pneumatic component overhaul
- Engine and APU maintenance
- Landing gear overhaul
- Electrical/electronic repair

**Staffing**: 20-100 technicians per shop
**Equipment**: Test benches, clean rooms, specialized tooling

### Spacecraft Ground Segment
**Location**: Near launch sites or mission control
**Capabilities**:
- Pre-launch integration and testing
- Fueling and final closeout
- Post-mission recovery and inspection
- Anomaly investigation and repair
- Refurbishment for reusable vehicles

**Staffing**: 10-50 engineers and technicians
**Equipment**: Clean rooms, handling fixtures, test equipment

## Geographic Considerations

### Operational Factors
- **Fleet Bases**: Minimize ferry time and cost
- **Utilization Patterns**: Maintenance performed where aircraft spend most time
- **Turn Times**: Quick turnaround for high-utilization routes
- **AOG Response**: 24/7 coverage across time zones

### Regulatory Factors
- **Certifications**: EASA Part-145, FAA Repair Station approvals
- **Import/Export**: Customs and duty implications for parts
- **Labor Laws**: Working time, licensing requirements
- **Environmental**: Noise, emissions, waste disposal regulations

### Commercial Factors
- **Labor Costs**: Wage rates and skill availability
- **Facility Costs**: Real estate, utilities, taxes
- **Supplier Access**: Parts availability and lead times
- **Competition**: MRO provider options and pricing

### Risk Factors
- **Geopolitical**: Political stability and trade relations
- **Natural Disasters**: Earthquake, hurricane, flood exposure
- **Pandemic**: Travel restrictions and workforce availability
- **Single Point of Failure**: Redundancy for critical capabilities

## Capacity Planning

### Demand Forecasting
```
Annual Maintenance Demand = Fleet Size × Annual Maintenance Hours per Aircraft
Facility Capacity = Hangar Bays × Bay Utilization × Shifts × Days per Year
```

**Inputs**:
- Fleet growth projections
- Aircraft utilization (flight hours per year)
- Maintenance program intervals
- Check durations (average days in hangar)

**Outputs**:
- Number and size of facilities required
- Workforce headcount by skill type
- Capital investment requirements
- Timing for facility expansions

### Workforce Planning
- **Direct Labor**: Mechanics, technicians, inspectors
- **Indirect Labor**: Planners, engineers, quality, stores
- **Ratio**: Typically 3-4 indirect for every 10 direct labor
- **Skill Mix**: Licensed engineers, specialized technicians, general mechanics
- **Training Lead Time**: 6-24 months for type rating and authorization

## Partnership Models

### In-House (Internal MRO)
**Advantages**:
- Full control over quality and scheduling
- Proprietary data and intellectual property protection
- Long-term cost efficiency for large fleets
- Strategic flexibility

**Disadvantages**:
- High capital investment
- Fixed cost structure regardless of utilization
- Limited economies of scale for small fleets
- Overhead burden

### Third-Party MRO Providers
**Advantages**:
- Variable cost structure (pay for what you use)
- Access to specialized capabilities
- No capital investment required
- Scalability for fleet changes

**Disadvantages**:
- Less control over schedule and quality
- Competitive sensitive data exposure
- Vendor dependency and switching costs
- Potentially higher long-term costs

### OEM Authorized Service Centers
**Advantages**:
- Factory-trained personnel
- Latest service bulletins and modifications
- Warranty and parts support
- Engineering support for complex issues

**Disadvantages**:
- Premium pricing
- Limited availability and lead times
- Tied to OEM parts and procedures
- Less flexibility for customization

### Joint Ventures and Alliances
**Advantages**:
- Shared investment and risk
- Combined expertise and capabilities
- Enhanced bargaining power with suppliers
- Access to new markets

**Disadvantages**:
- Governance complexity
- Conflicting interests and priorities
- Profit sharing reduces margins
- Exit complexity if partnership fails

## Network Optimization

### Make-vs-Buy Analysis
Decision criteria for each capability:
1. **Volume**: Is internal workload sufficient for efficiency?
2. **Criticality**: Does capability affect competitive advantage?
3. **Complexity**: Do we have the expertise?
4. **Capital**: Can we justify the investment?
5. **Flexibility**: Does in-house provide strategic options?

### Facility Location Model
Optimize for:
```
Minimize: Ferry Costs + Facility Costs + Labor Costs
Subject to:
- Sufficient capacity for maintenance demand
- Regulatory approvals obtainable
- Workforce availability
- Acceptable response times
```

### Performance Metrics
Track network effectiveness via [**../11-METRICS_AND_KPIs/**](../11-METRICS_AND_KPIs/):
- Average ferry distance and cost

- Turnaround time (days in maintenance)
- Cost per maintenance hour
- AOG response time
