## Certification Process

### Initial Certification

**Step 1: Pre-Application (Months 1-3)**
- Gap analysis against regulatory requirements
- Facility preparation and equipment procurement
- Quality manual and procedures development
- Personnel training and licensing

**Step 2: Formal Application (Month 4)**
- Submit application to authority
- Pay application fees
- Provide facility and capability documentation
- Nominate key personnel (accountable manager, quality)

**Step 3: Documentation Review (Months 5-6)**
- Authority reviews quality manual and procedures
- Requests for clarification and revisions
- Final approval of documentation

**Step 4: On-Site Audit (Month 7)**
- Facility inspection by authority
- Personnel interviews and competency checks
- Procedure demonstrations
- Records review

**Step 5: Certificate Issuance (Month 8)**
- Certificate granted with capability list
- Limitations and special conditions noted
- Validity period (typically 2 years for initial, continuous thereafter)

### Maintaining Certification

**Ongoing Obligations**:
- **Changes Notification**: 30 days advance notice for significant changes
- **Occurrence Reporting**: Mandatory reports for safety events
- **Access**: Allow authority inspectors at any time
- **Records**: Maintain and provide upon request
- **Compliance**: Follow approved procedures

**Surveillance Audits**:

- **Scope**: Sample of recent work, procedures, records
- **Findings**: Levels 1 (major), Level 2 (minor), observations
- **Response**: Corrective action plan within 30 days

**Renewal Audits**:

**Component Shops**: Specific component types

## Quality System Integration

### Document Control
- Certification documents (certificates, capability lists) in [**../06-QUALITY_AND_COMPLIANCE/**](../06-QUALITY_AND_COMPLIANCE/)
- Quality manual aligns with regulatory requirements
- Procedure updates require authority notification if significant

### Audit Management
- Authority findings tracked in NCR system
- Corrective actions monitored to closure
- See [**../06-QUALITY_AND_COMPLIANCE/AUDIT_PROGRAM.md**](../06-QUALITY_AND_COMPLIANCE/AUDIT_PROGRAM.md)

### Training Records
- Personnel certifications and authorizations
- Type training completion
- See [**../07-WORKFORCE_AND_TRAINING/COMPETENCY_MATRIX.md**](../07-WORKFORCE_AND_TRAINING/COMPETENCY_MATRIX.md)

## Certification Risks

### Common Findings Leading to Suspension
- **Falsification of Records**: Immediate suspension or revocation
- **Unapproved Work**: Performing work outside capability list
- **Unqualified Personnel**: Staff lacking required training/authorization
- **Inadequate Quality System**: Systematic non-compliance
- **Safety Issues**: Repeated safety-related defects

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Internal Audits**: Proactive compliance verification
- **Training**: Ensure all personnel understand requirements
- **Document Control**: Maintain current procedures
- **Compliance Culture**: Leadership commitment to regulations
- **Incident Response**: Rapid corrective action for issues

## International Operations

### Multiple Authority Approvals
**Why Needed**: Operations in multiple jurisdictions
**Example**: European operator with US fleet requires EASA and FAA

**Challenges**:
- **Different Requirements**: Some conflicts between regulations
- **Duplicate Audits**: Resource burden
- **Document Management**: Separate manuals or integrated

**Solutions**:
- **Bilateral Agreements**: Streamlined approval process
- **Harmonized Manuals**: Single quality manual satisfying both
- **Joint Audits**: Coordinate authority visits

### Foreign Repair Station
**FAA**: Foreign repair station certificate for non-US facilities
**EASA**: Third country approval for non-EU facilities

**Process**: Similar to domestic but may require:
- English-language documentation
- Authority acceptance of local regulations
- Additional oversight

## Technology and Digitalization

### Electronic Signatures
- Regulatory acceptance for maintenance release
- Requirements: Secure, auditable, non-repudiable
- Standards: FDA 21 CFR Part 11 principles applied

### Paperless Maintenance
- Electronic work packages and task cards
- Digital technical publications (IETM)
- Authority acceptance case-by-case
- See [**../02-TECHNICAL_PUBLICATIONS/IETM_STRATEGY.md**](../02-TECHNICAL_PUBLICATIONS/IETM_STRATEGY.md)

### Remote Maintenance Approval
- Video inspection for certain tasks
