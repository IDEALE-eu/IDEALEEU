## Overview

The MRO Model establishes the strategic foundation for maintenance operations, balancing:
- Operational requirements (fleet location, maintenance intervals)
- Regulatory constraints (certification authorities, facility approvals)
- Commercial considerations (cost structure, service pricing)
- Strategic partnerships (OEM support, MRO network alliances)

## Key Decisions

### Network Strategy
1. **Facility Location**: Strategic placement for geographic coverage and operational efficiency
2. **Capability Distribution**: Line maintenance, base maintenance, component overhaul distribution
3. **Partnerships**: OEM authorized service centers, third-party MRO agreements
4. **Mobile Units**: AOG (Aircraft On Ground) rapid response capability

### Certification Requirements
1. **EASA Part-145**: Maintenance organization approval
2. **FAA Repair Station**: 14 CFR Part 145 certification
3. **OEM Authorizations**: Type-specific approvals and training
4. **ISO Certifications**: AS9110 (aerospace maintenance quality)

### Business Models
1. **Time & Material**: Hourly labor rates plus parts
2. **Fixed Price**: Scheduled maintenance packages
3. **Power by the Hour**: Comprehensive coverage with guaranteed availability
4. **Hybrid Models**: Combining fixed and variable components
