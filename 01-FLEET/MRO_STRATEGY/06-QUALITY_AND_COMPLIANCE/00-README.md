## Overview

Quality and compliance ensures MRO operations meet:
- **Regulatory Standards**: EASA Part-145, FAA Repair Station, AS9110
- **Customer Requirements**: Contract specifications and SLAs
- **Safety Objectives**: Zero defects, first-time quality
- **Continuous Improvement**: Data-driven problem solving

## Quality Management System

### Quality Policy
- **Top Management Commitment**: CEO/accountable manager signature
- **Quality Objectives**: Measurable targets (defect rate, customer satisfaction)
- **Resource Allocation**: Budget, personnel, tools for quality
- **Communication**: Policy deployment throughout organization

### Quality Manual
- **Scope**: Activities, locations, certifications covered
- **Organization**: Roles, responsibilities, authorities
- **Processes**: Standard operating procedures (SOPs)
- **Records**: Document control and retention

See [**MRO_QUALITY_MANUAL.md**](MRO_QUALITY_MANUAL.md) for complete manual structure.

### Quality Standards
- **AS9110**: Aerospace maintenance, repair, and overhaul quality
- **ISO 9001**: General quality management system
- **EASA Part-145**: European maintenance organization requirements
- **FAA Part 145**: US repair station requirements

## NCR and CAPA

### Non-Conformance Reporting
- **Detection**: Inspection findings, customer complaints, audit observations
- **Documentation**: NCR form with description, evidence, severity
- **Containment**: Immediate action to prevent further occurrences
- **Disposition**: Repair, rework, scrap, use-as-is, return-to-supplier

### Root Cause Analysis
- **5 Whys**: Iterative questioning to find underlying cause
- **Fishbone Diagram**: Categorizing potential causes (man, machine, method, material)
- **Fault Tree Analysis**: Logical decomposition of failure scenarios
- **Pareto Analysis**: Focus on vital few vs. trivial many

### Corrective Action
- **Systemic Solutions**: Address root cause, not symptoms
- **Implementation**: Action plan with responsibilities and deadlines
- **Verification**: Confirm effectiveness through follow-up
- **Standardization**: Update procedures to prevent recurrence

### Preventive Action
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns before becoming problems
- **Risk Assessment**: Proactive mitigation of potential issues
- **Lessons Learned**: Apply knowledge from other sectors/fleets
- **Best Practices**: Implement industry-leading approaches

See [**NCR_CAPA_FOR_MRO.md**](NCR_CAPA_FOR_MRO.md) for detailed process.

## Audit Program

### Internal Audits
- **Frequency**: Annual coverage of all areas, risk-based prioritization
- **Auditors**: Trained internal personnel, independence from audited area
- **Checklist**: Compliance to procedures, regulations, contracts
- **Reports**: Findings, observations, opportunities for improvement

### External Audits
- **Regulatory**: EASA/FAA surveillance, renewal audits
- **Customer**: Airline/operator audits of MRO provider
- **Third-Party**: AS9110, ISO 9001 certification audits
- **Supplier**: MRO audits of parts suppliers and subcontractors

### Audit Findings
- **Classification**: Major (significant risk), minor (non-compliance), observation
- **Response**: Root cause analysis and corrective action plan
- **Verification**: Audit finding closure with evidence
- **Tracking**: Open findings database and aging reports

See [**AUDIT_PROGRAM.md**](AUDIT_PROGRAM.md) for audit schedule and procedures.

## Continuing Airworthiness

### Regulatory Requirements
- **EASA Part-M**: Continuing airworthiness management
- **EASA Part-CAMO**: CAMO approval and responsibilities
- **FAA Part 121/135**: Air carrier maintenance programs
- **Airworthiness Directives**: Mandatory compliance tracking

### Continuing Airworthiness File
- **Certificate of Airworthiness**: Current and valid
- **Maintenance Program**: Approved by authority
- **AD Compliance**: Status of all airworthiness directives
- **Modifications**: STCs, repairs, alterations
- **Life-Limited Parts**: Tracking and replacement records
- **Maintenance Records**: Complete history

See [**CONTINUING_AIRWORTHINESS_FILE/**](CONTINUING_AIRWORTHINESS_FILE/) for required documentation.

### Airworthiness Review
- **Certificate Renewal**: Annual or continuous airworthiness (EASA)
- **Documentation Review**: Verify completeness and currency
- **Physical Inspection**: Aircraft condition assessment
- **Recommendation**: Continue, conditional, suspend airworthiness

## Integration Points

### Configuration Management
- NCR-driven engineering changes (ECR)
- Modification compliance tracking
- See [**../08-INTEGRATIONS/CONFIG_MGMT_FEEDBACK.md**](../08-INTEGRATIONS/CONFIG_MGMT_FEEDBACK.md)

### Supply Chain
- Supplier NCRs and CARs (Corrective Action Requests)
- Unapproved parts investigations
- See [**../../../00-PROGRAM/SUPPLY_CHAIN/06-SUPPLIER_QUALITY/**](../../../00-PROGRAM/SUPPLY_CHAIN/06-SUPPLIER_QUALITY/)

### Maintenance Program
- Program effectiveness from NCR trends
- Continuing airworthiness compliance
- See [**../03-MAINTENANCE_PROGRAM/**](../03-MAINTENANCE_PROGRAM/)

### Workforce Training
- Training effectiveness from human error NCRs
- Competency assurance through audits
- See [**../07-WORKFORCE_AND_TRAINING/**](../07-WORKFORCE_AND_TRAINING/)

### Enterprise Quality
- Alignment with corporate QMS
- See [**../../../00-PROGRAM/QUALITY_QMS/**](../../../00-PROGRAM/QUALITY_QMS/)

## Metrics

Quality performance tracked in [**../11-METRICS_AND_KPIs/**](../11-METRICS_AND_KPIs/):
- Defect rate (per 1000 maintenance actions)
- NCR open/close cycle time
- Repeat defect rate
- Customer satisfaction score (CSAT)
- On-time delivery (maintenance to schedule)
- Audit findings (major/minor/observation)
- Training compliance rate
