## Overview

The maintenance program establishes the "what, when, and how" of maintaining fleet assets:
- **Tasks**: Specific maintenance activities (inspections, servicing, tests)
- **Intervals**: Calendar time, flight/orbit cycles, or condition-based triggers
- **Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions from technical publications
- **Resources**: Labor hours, tools, materials, and facilities required

## Aircraft Maintenance Program

### MPD Development Process
1. **MSG-3 Analysis**: Maintenance Steering Group logic for task development
   - Systems/Powerplants (SSI/PSI) analysis
   - Structures (ZSI) analysis  
   - Lightning/HIRF/EZAP analysis
2. **OEM Recommendations**: Manufacturer's baseline MPD
3. **Operator Customization**: Fleet-specific adjustments based on utilization
4. **Regulatory Approval**: Authority acceptance of maintenance program

### Task Categories
- **Lubrication (LUB)**: Fluid replenishment and application
- **Servicing (SVC)**: Consumable replenishment
- **Operational/Visual Check (OP/VC)**: Functional and visual inspections
- **Inspection (INS)**: Detailed examinations
- **Functional Check (FCO)**: System operational verification
- **Restoration (RST)**: Component overhaul or replacement
- **Discard (DIS)**: Hard-time component replacement

### Interval Types
- **Flight Hours (FH)**: Accumulated flight time
- **Flight Cycles (FC)**: Number of takeoff/landing cycles
- **Calendar Days (DY)**: Elapsed time
- **Condition Monitoring (CM)**: On-condition maintenance based on parameters

See [**AIRCRAFT/MPD_DERIVATION.md**](AIRCRAFT/MPD_DERIVATION.md) for detailed methodology.

## Spacecraft Maintenance Program

### Mission Support Planning
Spacecraft maintenance differs from aircraft due to:
- **Inaccessibility**: Limited or no physical access during mission
- **Autonomy**: Self-diagnostic and self-recovery capabilities
- **Redundancy**: Fault-tolerant design reduces maintenance criticality
- **Lifetime**: Often single-mission with no scheduled maintenance

Mission Support Plan covers:
1. **Pre-Launch**: Integration, testing, fueling, final closeout
2. **On-Orbit**: Telemetry monitoring, software updates, anomaly response
3. **Post-Mission**: Recovery, inspection, refurbishment (if reusable)
4. **Disposal**: De-orbit, graveyard orbit, or safe reentry

See [**SPACECRAFT/MSP_PLAN.md**](SPACECRAFT/MSP_PLAN.md) for framework details.

### Anomaly Resolution
Systematic approach to on-orbit anomalies:
1. **Detection**: Telemetry monitoring and automated alerts
2. **Classification**: Severity and impact assessment
3. **Investigation**: Fault isolation and root cause analysis
4. **Resolution**: Workaround, software patch, or hardware reconfiguration
5. **Prevention**: Design updates and operational procedure changes

See [**SPACECRAFT/ANOMALY_RESOLUTION_PROC.md**](SPACECRAFT/ANOMALY_RESOLUTION_PROC.md) for process details.

## Reliability Program

Continuous monitoring and improvement of maintenance program effectiveness:

### Data Collection
- **Maintenance Events**: Task completions, findings, no-fault-found (NFF)
- **Operational Interruptions**: Delays, cancellations, diversions
- **Component Removals**: Unscheduled removals and causes
- **Alert Service Bulletins**: Industry fleet experience

### Analysis Methods
- **PIREP/MAREP**: Pilot/maintenance reports analysis
- **Fleet Trend Analysis**: Rate-based reliability metrics (IFSD, delays)
- **Component Reliability**: Mean time between removal (MTBR)
- **System Effectiveness**: Dispatch reliability by ATA chapter

### Program Adjustments
- **Task Escalation**: Increase interval for reliable items
- **Task De-escalation**: Decrease interval for problematic items
- **Task Addition**: New tasks for emerging issues
- **Task Deletion**: Remove ineffective tasks

See [**AIRCRAFT/RELIABILITY_PROGRAM.md**](AIRCRAFT/RELIABILITY_PROGRAM.md) for methodologies.
