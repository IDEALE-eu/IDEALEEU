# 05-LOGISTICS_SUPPORT

Spares strategy, supply chain integration, and tooling/GSE management for MRO operations.

## Purpose

Ensure material availability and logistics readiness to support maintenance operations with minimal aircraft/spacecraft downtime and optimized inventory investment.

## Overview

Logistics support is critical to MRO effectiveness:
- **Right Part**: Correct part number, specification, and certification
- **Right Time**: Available when needed to minimize downtime
- **Right Place**: Positioned at maintenance location or rapidly deliverable
- **Right Cost**: Optimized inventory investment vs. availability

## Spares Strategy

### Provisioning Analysis
- **Reliability Data**: MTBR (Mean Time Between Removal) from fleet experience
- **Criticality**: AOG risk and operational impact assessment
- **Lead Times**: Supplier delivery performance and expedite capability
- **Costs**: Unit price, carrying cost, obsolescence risk

### Stocking Policies
- **Rotable Pool**: Serviceable units with repair/overhaul cycle
- **Consumable Stock**: Expendable items (fluids, fasteners, seals)
- **Insurance Spares**: Low-probability, high-impact items
- **No-Stock**: Common items available from suppliers within acceptable time

### Inventory Optimization
- **Min/Max Levels**: Reorder point and maximum stock quantity
- **Safety Stock**: Buffer for demand variability and supply uncertainty
- **ABC Analysis**: Pareto prioritization (A: critical/expensive, C: low-value)
- **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**: Balancing order costs vs. carrying costs

See [**SPARES_STRATEGY.md**](SPARES_STRATEGY.md) for methodology details.

## Supply Chain Integration

### Supplier Management
- **OEM Parts**: Direct from manufacturer with full traceability
- **PMA Parts**: FAA/EASA approved alternatives
- **DER Repairs**: Designated Engineering Representative repairs
- **Surplus Market**: Cost-effective sources for mature platforms

### AOG Response
- **24/7 Availability**: Round-the-clock parts support
- **Expedited Shipping**: Air freight, hand-carry, same-day delivery
- **Loan/Exchange**: Temporary units while permanent solution arranged
- **Global Network**: Parts distribution centers strategically located

### Traceability
- **Chain of Custody**: Documentation from manufacture to installation
- **Certifications**: FAA Form 8130-3, EASA Form 1, manufacturer COC
- **Counterfeit Prevention**: Supplier audits, incoming inspection, blockchain
- **Lifecycle Tracking**: Serial numbers, time/cycles, repair history

See [**SUPPLY_CHAIN_FOR_MRO.md**](SUPPLY_CHAIN_FOR_MRO.md) for processes and procedures.

## Tooling and GSE

### Special Tools
- **OEM Tooling**: Manufacturer-specific tools for assembly/disassembly
- **Test Equipment**: Rigging, calibration, functional test apparatus
- **Lifting/Handling**: Engine stands, wing jacks, spacecraft handling fixtures
- **Access Equipment**: Platforms, scaffolding, work stands

### Ground Support Equipment
- **Power**: GPU (Ground Power Unit), battery chargers
- **Air Conditioning**: Pre-conditioned air, thermal control
- **Hydraulics**: Mule, hydraulic test bench
- **Fueling**: Defueling equipment, contamination detection

### Calibration Management
- **Calibration Schedule**: Periodic verification against standards
- **Calibration Lab**: NIST-traceable standards and procedures
- **Out-of-Tolerance**: Investigation and impact assessment
- **Records**: Calibration certificates and audit trail

See [**TOOLING_GSE_FOR_MRO.md**](TOOLING_GSE_FOR_MRO.md) for asset management.

## Integration Points

### Supply Chain Program
- Supplier qualification and performance tracking
- Purchase orders and contract management
- SCAR (Supplier Corrective Action Request) coordination
- See [**../../../00-PROGRAM/SUPPLY_CHAIN/**](../../../00-PROGRAM/SUPPLY_CHAIN/)

### Configuration Management
- Part number control and effectivity
- Engineering changes impact on spares
- Obsolescence management
- See [**../08-INTEGRATIONS/CONFIG_MGMT_FEEDBACK.md**](../08-INTEGRATIONS/CONFIG_MGMT_FEEDBACK.md)

### Maintenance Program
- Task requirements drive spares consumption
- Reliability data informs provisioning
- Maintenance findings trigger warranty claims
- See [**../03-MAINTENANCE_PROGRAM/**](../03-MAINTENANCE_PROGRAM/)

### Predictive Maintenance
- Prognostics enable proactive parts ordering
- Reduced emergency procurement and expedite costs
- Better inventory turnover through demand forecasting
- See [**../04-PREDICTIVE_MAINTENANCE/**](../04-PREDICTIVE_MAINTENANCE/)

### Quality System
- Parts receiving inspection
