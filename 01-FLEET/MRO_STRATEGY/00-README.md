# MRO_STRATEGY

Comprehensive Maintenance, Repair, and Operations strategy for aircraft and spacecraft fleet management.

## Overview

The MRO_STRATEGY directory defines the complete framework for maintaining continued airworthiness and operational readiness across the IDEALE-EU fleet. This encompasses both aircraft (CAS - Continued Airworthiness Support, CMP - Continued Maintenance Program) and spacecraft (Mission Support Plans, anomaly resolution) operations.

## Purpose

Establish policies, procedures, and integration points for:
- Maintenance program development and execution
- Technical publications and IETM (Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals)
- Predictive maintenance using digital twin technology
- Quality assurance and regulatory compliance
- Workforce competency and training
- Integration with broader program systems

## Integration with Program

### Fleet Operations
MRO Strategy integrates with other Fleet components:
- [**../OPERATIONAL_DATA_HUB/**](../OPERATIONAL_DATA_HUB/) - Real-time sensor data and usage profiles inform maintenance scheduling
- [**../FEDERATED_LEARNING/**](../FEDERATED_LEARNING/) - ML models provide predictive maintenance insights
  - [**../FEDERATED_LEARNING/14-INTEGRATIONS/MRO_FEEDBACK_LOOP.md**](../FEDERATED_LEARNING/14-INTEGRATIONS/MRO_FEEDBACK_LOOP.md) - Anomaly detection and feedback loop
- [**../FLEET_OPTIMISATION/**](../FLEET_OPTIMISATION/) - Maintenance windows coordinated with operational schedules

### Configuration Management
Links to [**../../00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/**](../../00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/) for:
- Engineering change requests (ECR) from maintenance findings
- Configuration status accounting and effectivity tracking
- Baseline management for maintenance documentation
- See [**08-INTEGRATIONS/CONFIG_MGMT_FEEDBACK.md**](08-INTEGRATIONS/CONFIG_MGMT_FEEDBACK.md)

### Supply Chain
Coordinates with [**../../00-PROGRAM/SUPPLY_CHAIN/**](../../00-PROGRAM/SUPPLY_CHAIN/) for:
- Spare parts procurement and inventory management
- Supplier Corrective Action Requests (SCAR) for component failures
- Tooling and GSE (Ground Support Equipment) requirements
- See [**05-LOGISTICS_SUPPORT/**](05-LOGISTICS_SUPPORT/)

### Quality Management
Interfaces with [**../../00-PROGRAM/QUALITY_QMS/**](../../00-PROGRAM/QUALITY_QMS/) for:
- Non-conformance reports (NCR) and corrective actions (CAPA)
- Audit programs and compliance verification
- Quality manual alignment
- See [**06-QUALITY_AND_COMPLIANCE/**](06-QUALITY_AND_COMPLIANCE/)

### Digital Thread
Integration with [**../../00-PROGRAM/DIGITAL_THREAD/**](../../00-PROGRAM/DIGITAL_THREAD/) for:
- Maintenance event traceability to design and requirements
- Digital twin model updates from field data
- UTCS (Universal Traceability and Configuration System) anchors
- See [**08-INTEGRATIONS/DIGITAL_THREAD_HOOKS.md**](08-INTEGRATIONS/DIGITAL_THREAD_HOOKS.md)

## Key Processes

### Maintenance Planning
1. **Aircraft**: MPD (Maintenance Planning Document) derivation from manufacturer recommendations
2. **Spacecraft**: MSP (Mission Support Plan) based on mission profile and orbital parameters
3. **Reliability**: MSG-3 analysis and reliability-centered maintenance (RCM)

### Predictive Maintenance
1. **Health Monitoring**: Real-time HUMS (Health and Usage Monitoring Systems)
2. **Digital Twin**: Virtual representation synchronized with physical asset
3. **ML Models**: Anomaly detection and prognostic algorithms
4. **Feedback Loop**: Continuous improvement from maintenance findings

### Quality and Compliance
1. **Continuing Airworthiness**: Maintain design approval and airworthiness certification
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: EASA Part-M, Part-145, FAA Part 121/135
3. **Audit Program**: Internal and external audit schedules
4. **NCR/CAPA**: Systematic issue resolution and root cause analysis

### Workforce Management
1. **Competency**: Type rating and task authorization tracking
2. **Training**: Initial, recurrent, and differences training programs
3. **Simulation**: Maintenance training simulators and AR/VR tools

## Regulatory Framework

### Aircraft Operations
- **EASA Part-M**: Continuing Airworthiness Management
- **EASA Part-145**: Approved Maintenance Organizations
