# 01-FLEET

Global fleet operations, federated learning, and strategy.

## Overview

The Fleet layer manages operational data, implements federated learning across all vehicles, and optimizes fleet-wide operations and maintenance strategies.

## Contents

- **OPERATIONAL_DATA_HUB/** - EIS (Entry Into Service) data, sensor logs, usage profiles
- **FEDERATED_LEARNING/** - Fleet-wide machine learning models and algorithms
- **MRO_STRATEGY/** - CAS (Continued Airworthiness Support) and CMP (Continued Maintenance Program) policies
- **FLEET_OPTIMISATION/** - Scheduling, resource allocation, and efficiency optimization

## Key Functions

### Operational Data Hub
- Collect and aggregate sensor data from all vehicles
- Track usage profiles and operational patterns
- Monitor fleet health and performance
- Provide data for predictive maintenance

### Federated Learning
- Implement distributed machine learning across the fleet
- Share insights while preserving data privacy
- Continuously improve vehicle performance
- Detect anomalies and predict failures

### MRO Strategy
- Define maintenance intervals and procedures
- Track component life cycles
- Manage spare parts inventory
- Optimize maintenance costs

### Fleet Optimisation
- Schedule operations efficiently
- Allocate resources optimally
- Reduce operational costs
- Maximize fleet availability

## Interface with Design

The Fleet layer provides critical feedback to design teams:
- Usage data informs design improvements
- Operational insights drive configuration updates
- Maintenance data guides reliability enhancements
- Learning models improve vehicle intelligence
