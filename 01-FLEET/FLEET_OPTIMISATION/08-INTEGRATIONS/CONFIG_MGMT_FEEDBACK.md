# Config Management Feedback

## Overview

Configuration management feedback loops ensure that operational experience, maintenance findings, and fleet optimization insights inform configuration management decisions, modifications, and continuous improvement.

## Feedback Categories

### Design and Configuration Changes
- Operational issues requiring design changes
- Modifications to improve reliability or performance
- Service bulletin implementation priorities
- Configuration optimization opportunities

### Reliability and Performance Data
- Component reliability and failure modes
- System performance vs. specifications
- Usage patterns and stress factors
- Aging and deterioration trends

### Maintenance Optimization
- Maintenance interval adjustments
- Task refinement and optimization
- Tooling and procedure improvements
- Training and competency needs

### Lessons Learned
- Operational best practices
- Maintenance best practices
- Risk mitigation measures
- Continuous improvement initiatives

## Data Flows

### To Configuration Management
- Change requests and proposals
- Operational data supporting changes
- Failure reports and analysis
- Cost-benefit analysis for modifications

### From Configuration Management
- Configuration baselines and changes
- Modification status and schedules
- Technical documentation updates
- Change impact assessments

## Feedback Mechanisms

### Regular Reviews
- Configuration control board (CCB) participation
- Quarterly performance reviews
- Annual program reviews
- Continuous improvement workshops

### Event-Driven Feedback
- Incident and accident investigations
- Reliability issues and trends
- Cost overruns or inefficiencies
- Customer complaints or requirements

### Metrics and Reporting
- Configuration effectiveness measures
- Operational impact of changes
- Cost and schedule performance
- Lessons learned documentation
