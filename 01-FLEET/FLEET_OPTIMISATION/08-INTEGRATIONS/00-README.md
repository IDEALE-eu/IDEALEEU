# 08-INTEGRATIONS

Digital thread integration, data flows, and system interfaces.

## Overview

This directory defines integration points between fleet optimization systems and other digital systems including the digital thread, MRO strategy, operational data hub, and configuration management.

## Contents

- **00-README.md** - This file
- **DIGITAL_THREAD_HOOKS.md** - Integration with digital thread for traceability
- **MRO_STRATEGY_LINK.md** - Connection to MRO strategy and execution systems
- **OPERATIONAL_DATA_HUB_FEED.md** - Data flows from operational data hub
- **CONFIG_MGMT_FEEDBACK.md** - Feedback loops to configuration management

## Key Functions

### Data Integration
- Bidirectional data flows
- Real-time and batch interfaces
- Data quality and validation
- Master data management

### System Integration
- API and web services
- Message queuing and events
- File transfers and ETL
- Database integration

### Process Integration
- Workflow orchestration
- Cross-system processes
- Approval and escalation
- Notification and alerts

## Integration Architecture

### Upstream Systems
- **Digital Thread**: Requirements, design, configuration data
- **Operational Data Hub**: Flight data, sensor data, usage profiles
- **MRO Systems**: Maintenance plans, work orders, completions
- **Configuration Management**: Configuration baselines, changes

### Downstream Systems
- **Fleet Planning**: Demand and capacity updates
- **Maintenance Systems**: Scheduled maintenance requirements
- **Resource Systems**: Crew and infrastructure needs
- **Analytics**: Performance data for modeling

## Key Deliverables

1. **Integration Specifications** - Interface definitions and protocols
2. **Data Flow Diagrams** - Visual representation of data movement
3. **API Documentation** - Technical interface specifications
4. **Integration Testing Plans** - Validation and verification procedures
