# MRO Strategy Link

## Overview

Integration with MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul) strategy ensures alignment between fleet optimization planning and maintenance execution, enabling coordinated decision-making and resource optimization.

## Integration Areas

### Maintenance Program Alignment
- Coordinate maintenance intervals with operational schedules
- Optimize maintenance windows to minimize operational impact
- Balance preventive and predictive maintenance approaches
- Synchronize fleet and MRO capacity planning

### Resource Coordination
- Share maintenance capacity and capability data
- Coordinate technician and facility scheduling
- Align spare parts planning and inventory
- Optimize maintenance location decisions

### Performance Feedback
- Share operational performance and reliability data
- Provide maintenance effectiveness metrics
- Feed lessons learned into MRO strategy
- Continuous improvement initiatives

## Data Exchanges

### From MRO Strategy
- Maintenance schedules and forecasts
- Resource capacity and constraints
- Maintenance cost data
- Technical capabilities and certifications

### To MRO Strategy
- Operational schedules and priorities
- Aircraft/spacecraft availability requirements
- Performance targets and KPIs
- Fleet utilization plans

## Benefits

- Optimized maintenance timing
- Reduced operational disruptions
- Better resource utilization
- Lower total cost of ownership
- Improved fleet availability
