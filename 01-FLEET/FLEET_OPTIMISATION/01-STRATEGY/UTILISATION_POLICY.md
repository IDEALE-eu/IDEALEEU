# Utilization Policy

## Overview

This document defines policies, targets, and guidelines for optimizing fleet utilization to maximize operational efficiency and financial performance while maintaining safety and reliability.

## Strategic Goals

- Maximize revenue-generating operations
- Minimize idle time and non-productive periods
- Balance utilization with maintenance requirements
- Optimize crew and resource productivity
- Maintain safety and reliability standards

## Utilization Targets

### Aircraft Utilization
- **Daily flight hours**: [Target range] hours per aircraft per day
- **Monthly cycles**: [Target range] flight cycles per aircraft per month
- **Annual utilization**: [Target range] hours per aircraft per year
- **Load factor**: [Target]% average passenger/cargo capacity utilization

### Spacecraft Utilization
- **Mission hours**: [Target range] operational hours per spacecraft per year
- **Mission frequency**: [Target range] missions per spacecraft per year
- **Payload utilization**: [Target]% average payload capacity utilization
- **On-orbit availability**: [Target]% time in operational status

### Ground Time Targets
- Turnaround time (aircraft): [Target] minutes
- Pre-mission preparation (spacecraft): [Target] days
- Post-mission processing (spacecraft): [Target] days

## Utilization Policies

### Allocation Principles
1. **Mission priority** - Critical missions first, then revenue optimization
2. **Vehicle suitability** - Match vehicle capability to mission requirements
3. **Economic efficiency** - Minimize cost per mission while meeting requirements
4. **Balanced usage** - Distribute utilization to avoid overuse/underuse of specific vehicles
5. **Maintenance integration** - Schedule missions to align with maintenance windows

### Assignment Rules
- New vehicles: Ramp-up period with reduced utilization initially
- High-hour vehicles: Managed utilization approaching scheduled maintenance
- Reserve vehicles: Minimum utilization to maintain readiness
- Specialized vehicles: Mission-specific allocation based on unique capabilities

### Utilization Limits
- **Maximum daily/monthly hours**: Safety and fatigue limits
- **Minimum utilization**: Economic viability thresholds
- **Seasonal adjustments**: Accommodate demand fluctuations
- **Maintenance reserves**: Buffer capacity for unscheduled maintenance

## Optimization Strategies

### Scheduling Optimization
- Flight/mission pairing algorithms
- Crew pairing and rostering integration
- Network optimization for aircraft routing
- Mission sequencing for spacecraft operations

### Load Factor Improvement
- Demand forecasting and capacity matching
- Revenue management and pricing strategies
- Cargo and payload optimization
- Mixed passenger/cargo operations where applicable

### Asset Productivity
- Minimize ground time between missions
- Quick turnaround procedures and best practices
- Flexible deployment across operational bases
- Reduce non-revenue positioning flights/transits

### Lifecycle Management
- Front-load utilization on new vehicles (burn-in period)
- Manage end-of-life vehicles with reduced utilization
- Balance utilization across fleet to equalize aging
- Coordinate with maintenance and retirement schedules

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- **Utilization rate**: Actual hours/cycles vs. target
- **Availability**: Percentage of time fleet is operationally available
- **On-time performance**: Missions completed as scheduled
- **Load factor**: Actual vs. available capacity
- **Cost per hour/mission**: Operating cost efficiency

### Reporting Frequency
- Daily: Operational status and utilization
- Weekly: Utilization trends and issues
- Monthly: Performance vs. targets and analysis
- Quarterly: Strategic review and policy adjustments

### Variance Analysis
- Identify underutilized vehicles and root causes
- Investigate overutilization and potential issues
- Assess impact of delays, cancellations, maintenance
- Benchmark against industry standards

## Constraints and Considerations

### Safety and Regulatory
- Flight duty time limits (crew)
- Maintenance intervals and checks
- Airworthiness directives and compliance
- Environmental restrictions (noise, emissions)

### Operational
- Weather and seasonal factors
- Infrastructure capacity (gates, ground support)
- Crew availability and qualifications
- Spare parts and consumables availability

### Commercial
- Demand patterns and seasonality
- Contractual commitments and SLAs
- Market conditions and competition
- Revenue and profitability targets

## Scenario Planning

### High Demand Scenario
- Increase utilization towards maximum safe limits
- Deploy reserve capacity
- Optimize scheduling for maximum throughput
- Consider short-term leasing or partnerships

### Low Demand Scenario
- Reduce utilization while maintaining economic viability
- Park or sublease excess capacity
- Accelerate maintenance and modifications
- Adjust crew and resource levels

### Disruption Scenario
- Contingency utilization of reserve fleet
- Re-optimize schedules around disruptions
- Prioritize critical missions
- Recover utilization post-disruption

## Governance

### Policy Review
- Annual review of utilization targets and policies
- Quarterly assessment of performance trends
- Ad-hoc reviews for significant events or changes

### Decision Authority
- Utilization target setting: [Authority level]
- Policy exceptions: [Authority level]
- Resource allocation: [Authority level]

### Stakeholder Involvement
- Operations: Daily execution and feedback
- Planning: Demand forecasting and scheduling
- Maintenance: Maintenance window coordination
- Finance: Economic analysis and targets

## Integration with Other Functions

### Demand Planning
- Coordinate with **02-DEMAND_PLANNING/** for mission forecasts
- Align capacity with demand projections
- Inform capacity planning decisions

### Maintenance Planning
- Integrate with **04-MAINTENANCE_PLANNING/** for maintenance schedules
- Balance utilization with maintenance windows
- Optimize maintenance reserve requirements

### Cost Optimization
- Support **06-COST_OPTIMISATION/** with efficiency data
- Target cost per unit utilization
- Identify cost reduction opportunities

## Best Practices

- Continuous monitoring and real-time adjustment
- Data-driven decision making with analytics
- Cross-functional collaboration and communication
- Benchmarking against industry leaders
- Culture of efficiency and accountability
