# Fleet Mix Strategy

## Overview

The fleet mix strategy defines the optimal composition of the fleet across different vehicle types, capabilities, and age profiles to meet mission requirements cost-effectively.

## Strategic Objectives

- Meet operational demand across all mission profiles
- Optimize capital and operating costs
- Maintain operational flexibility and resilience
- Balance standardization with capability diversity
- Plan for technology refresh and modernization

## Current Fleet Composition

### Aircraft Fleet
- **Type A**: [Number] units - [Primary mission/capability]
- **Type B**: [Number] units - [Primary mission/capability]
- **Type C**: [Number] units - [Primary mission/capability]

### Spacecraft Fleet
- **Type X**: [Number] units - [Primary mission/capability]
- **Type Y**: [Number] units - [Primary mission/capability]

### Age Profile
- 0-5 years: [Percentage]%
- 5-10 years: [Percentage]%
- 10-15 years: [Percentage]%
- 15+ years: [Percentage]%

## Mission Profile Analysis

### Mission Categories
1. **High-frequency short-range** - [Vehicle types suited]
2. **Medium-range standard** - [Vehicle types suited]
3. **Long-range extended** - [Vehicle types suited]
4. **Specialized missions** - [Vehicle types suited]

### Demand Forecast
- Current annual missions: [Number]
- 5-year forecast: [Growth/decline trend]
- Mission mix evolution: [Expected changes]

## Optimization Criteria

### Financial
- Total cost of ownership (TCO)
- Capital expenditure limits
- Operating cost per mission
- Residual value and depreciation

### Operational
- Mission capability coverage
- Utilization rates and efficiency
- Operational flexibility
- Maintenance burden and complexity

### Strategic
- Technology roadmap alignment
- Supplier and support ecosystem
- Environmental and sustainability goals
- Regulatory compliance and future-proofing

## Fleet Evolution Plan

### Near-Term (0-2 years)
- Maintain current mix with minor adjustments
- Address immediate capacity constraints
- Retire end-of-life vehicles
- Complete committed acquisitions

### Mid-Term (3-5 years)
- Introduce next-generation vehicles
- Rebalance mix based on mission evolution
- Standardize on core platform families
- Divest underutilized vehicle types

### Long-Term (5+ years)
- Transition to advanced propulsion systems
- Integrate autonomous and AI-enabled vehicles
- Achieve target fleet composition
- Continuous optimization and adaptation

## Decision Framework

### New Vehicle Introduction
- Business case requirements (ROI, payback)
- Capability gap analysis
- Commonality and support considerations
- Risk assessment

### Vehicle Retirement
- Economic life determination
- Maintenance cost escalation triggers
- Technological obsolescence
- Market conditions for disposal/resale

## Scenario Analysis

### Growth Scenario
- Fleet expansion requirements
- Investment needs and phasing
- Resource scaling (crew, maintenance)

### Contraction Scenario
- Fleet reduction priorities
- Cost savings and efficiency gains
- Redeployment and disposal strategy

### Technology Disruption
- Rapid adoption of new propulsion/systems
- Accelerated retirement of legacy vehicles
- Transition risks and mitigation

## Governance

### Review Cycle
- Annual strategic review
- Quarterly performance vs. targets
- Ad-hoc reviews for major events

### Approval Authority
- Fleet composition changes: [Authority level]
- Major acquisitions: [Authority level]
- Retirement decisions: [Authority level]

### Stakeholders
- Operations leadership
- Finance and procurement
- Engineering and maintenance
- Commercial and planning

## Key Metrics

- Fleet size by vehicle type
- Average fleet age
- Utilization rates by vehicle type
- TCO per vehicle and per mission
- Mission capability coverage
- Fleet readiness and availability
