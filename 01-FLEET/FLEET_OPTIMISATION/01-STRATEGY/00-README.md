# 01-STRATEGY

Fleet mix strategy, utilization policies, and lifecycle cost models.

## Overview

This directory contains strategic planning documents that define the optimal composition, utilization, and economic management of the fleet. These strategies guide decisions on fleet size, mix, deployment, and lifecycle management to achieve operational and financial objectives.

## Contents

- **00-README.md** - This file
- **[FLEET_MIX_STRATEGY.md](FLEET_MIX_STRATEGY.md)** - Optimal fleet composition and vehicle type selection
- **[UTILISATION_POLICY.md](UTILISATION_POLICY.md)** - Utilization targets, policies, and optimization guidelines
- **[LIFECYCLE_COST_MODEL.md](LIFECYCLE_COST_MODEL.md)** - Total cost of ownership and lifecycle economic analysis

## Key Topics

### Fleet Mix Strategy
- Vehicle type selection and rationale
- Fleet size determination
- Mix optimization across mission profiles
- New vehicle introduction planning
- Retirement and replacement strategy
- Flexibility and scalability considerations

### Utilization Policy
- Target utilization rates by vehicle type
- Operational availability requirements
- Mission allocation policies
- Load factor optimization
- Seasonal and cyclical planning
- Reserve capacity guidelines

### Lifecycle Cost Model
- Acquisition costs (purchase, lease, financing)
- Operating costs (fuel, crew, handling)
- Maintenance and repair costs (scheduled, unscheduled)
- Depreciation and residual value
- Total cost of ownership (TCO)
- Cost-benefit analysis and ROI

## Integration
