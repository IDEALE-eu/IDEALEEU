Fuel consumption and energy efficiency optimization programs.

## Overview

Programs and initiatives to reduce fuel consumption and improve energy efficiency across aircraft and spacecraft operations, reducing costs and environmental impact.

## Key Areas

### Aircraft Fuel Efficiency
- Flight planning optimization
- Weight reduction programs
- Aerodynamic improvements
- Engine performance monitoring
- Operational procedures (continuous descent, single-engine taxi)

### Spacecraft Energy Efficiency
- Power system optimization
- Thermal management
- Propellant efficiency
- Solar array and battery management

## Metrics

- Fuel burn per flight hour or kilometer
- Energy consumption per mission
- Efficiency trends over time
- Industry benchmarking
