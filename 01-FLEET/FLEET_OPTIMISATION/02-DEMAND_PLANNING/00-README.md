# 02-DEMAND_PLANNING

Demand forecasting, capacity planning, and operational scheduling.

## Overview

This directory contains demand planning and scheduling processes for both aircraft operations and spacecraft missions. It encompasses demand forecasting, capacity planning, schedule development, and optimization to match fleet capacity with operational requirements.

## Contents

- **00-README.md** - This file
- **[AIRCRAFT_SCHEDULES/](AIRCRAFT_SCHEDULES/)** - Flight schedules, route planning, and aircraft assignments
- **[SPACECRAFT_MISSION_PLAN/](SPACECRAFT_MISSION_PLAN/)** - Mission schedules, orbit planning, and spacecraft assignments
- **[CAPACITY_FORECASTING.md](CAPACITY_FORECASTING.md)** - Demand forecasting and capacity requirement analysis

## Key Functions

### Demand Forecasting
- Historical demand analysis and trending
- Market intelligence and demand drivers
- Statistical forecasting models
- Scenario planning (base, high, low cases)
- Seasonal and cyclical patterns
- Special events and anomalies

### Capacity Planning
- Fleet capacity assessment
- Capacity vs. demand gap analysis
- Capacity expansion/reduction planning
- Load factor optimization
- Flexibility and reserve capacity

### Schedule Development
- Aircraft route network and frequency planning
- Spacecraft mission manifest development
- Crew and resource assignments
- Ground infrastructure coordination
- Schedule optimization and conflict resolution

### Schedule Execution
- Real-time schedule monitoring
- Disruption management and recovery
- Schedule adherence tracking
- Performance analysis and continuous improvement

## Integration

### Upstream Inputs
- Fleet mix and availability from **[01-STRATEGY/](../01-STRATEGY/)**
- Resource availability from **[03-RESOURCES_OPTIMISATION/](../03-RESOURCES_OPTIMISATION/)**
- Maintenance windows from **[04-MAINTENANCE_PLANNING/](../04-MAINTENANCE_PLANNING/)**
- Operational constraints from **[05-OPERATIONAL_PERFORMANCE/](../05-OPERATIONAL_PERFORMANCE/)**

### Downstream Outputs
- Operational schedules for execution
- Resource requirements for planning
- Capacity forecasts for fleet planning
- Performance targets for monitoring

## Key Deliverables

1. **Demand Forecasts** - Short, medium, and long-term demand projections
2. **Capacity Plans** - Fleet capacity requirements and deployment strategies
3. **Operational Schedules** - Aircraft flight schedules and spacecraft mission plans
4. **Schedule Performance Reports** - Adherence, utilization, and optimization metrics
5. **Scenario Analyses** - Contingency plans and what-if scenarios
