# Capacity Forecasting

## Overview

Capacity forecasting analyzes demand trends and patterns to project future capacity requirements, enabling proactive fleet planning, resource allocation, and strategic decision-making for both aircraft and spacecraft operations.

## Forecasting Objectives

- Project future demand for operational capacity
- Identify capacity gaps and surpluses
- Support fleet planning and investment decisions
- Enable proactive resource planning
- Optimize capacity utilization and financial performance

## Forecasting Methodology

### 1. Historical Data Analysis

#### Data Sources
- Operational history: **01-FLEET/OPERATIONAL_DATA_HUB/**
- Sales and booking data
- Market intelligence and trends
- Economic indicators and drivers
- Competitor activity and capacity

#### Key Metrics
- Flight/mission volumes and frequency
- Load factors and utilization
- Revenue passenger/cargo kilometers
- Seasonal patterns and cycles
- Growth trends and volatility

### 2. Demand Drivers

#### Macro Drivers
- GDP growth and economic conditions
- Population growth and demographics
- Trade and commerce activity
- Technology adoption and innovation
- Regulatory and policy changes

#### Market Drivers
- Customer demand and preferences
- Competitive landscape and market share
- Pricing and yield dynamics
- Route/mission network expansion
- New market entry and development

#### Internal Drivers
- Fleet expansion or contraction
- Network restructuring
- Service improvements and differentiation
- Marketing and sales initiatives
- Operational efficiency improvements

### 3. Forecasting Techniques

#### Statistical Methods
- Time series analysis (ARIMA, exponential smoothing)
- Regression analysis (linear, multivariate)
- Seasonal decomposition
- Trend extrapolation
- Moving averages

#### Causal Models
- Econometric models (GDP, trade, tourism)
- Market share models
- Gravity models (for route demand)
- Choice models (for customer behavior)

#### Judgmental Methods
- Expert opinion and Delphi method
- Scenario planning
- Market research and surveys
- Analogies and benchmarking

#### Hybrid Approaches
- Combine statistical and judgmental
- Bottom-up and top-down reconciliation
- Ensemble forecasting (multiple models)

### 4. Scenario Planning

#### Base Case
- Most likely demand trajectory
- Moderate economic growth
- Stable competitive environment
- Continuation of trends

#### High Growth Case
- Strong economic expansion
- Market share gains
- Network expansion success
- Technology-driven demand growth

#### Low Growth Case
- Economic downturn or stagnation
- Competitive pressure and share loss
- Capacity overcapacity in market
- Regulatory or geopolitical challenges

#### Disruptive Scenarios
- Technology disruption (autonomous, electric, space tourism)
- Major geopolitical events
- Pandemic or environmental crisis
- Paradigm shift in customer behavior

## Forecast Outputs

### Demand Forecast
- **Volume**: Number of flights/missions, passengers, cargo tonnage
- **Capacity**: Required seat-kilometers, payload capacity
- **Frequency**: Flights per route/mission per period
- **Seasonality**: Monthly/quarterly patterns
- **Geographic**: By region, route, market segment

### Capacity Requirements
- **Fleet size**: Number of aircraft/spacecraft by type
- **Utilization**: Required hours/missions per vehicle
- **Mix**: Optimal fleet composition
- **Timing**: Phasing of capacity additions/reductions

### Gap Analysis
- Demand vs. available capacity
- Surplus or deficit by period
- Bottlenecks and constraints
- Investment requirements

## Forecasting Horizons

### Short-Term (0-12 months)
- **Purpose**: Operational planning, resource scheduling
- **Granularity**: Weekly or monthly
- **Accuracy Target**: ±5%
- **Update Frequency**: Monthly or continuous

### Medium-Term (1-3 years)
- **Purpose**: Fleet planning, resource investment
- **Granularity**: Quarterly or annual
- **Accuracy Target**: ±10%
- **Update Frequency**: Quarterly

### Long-Term (3-10 years)
- **Purpose**: Strategic planning, major investments
- **Granularity**: Annual
- **Accuracy Target**: ±20%
- **Update Frequency**: Annual or bi-annual

## Forecast Performance

### Accuracy Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Average percentage deviation
- **Bias**: Systematic over- or under-forecasting
- **Tracking Signal**: Cumulative forecast error
- **Forecast Value Added (FVA)**: Improvement over naive forecast

### Monitoring and Review
- Track actual vs. forecast monthly
- Investigate significant variances
- Adjust models and assumptions
- Conduct post-mortem analysis

### Continuous Improvement
- Refine models based on performance
- Incorporate new data sources
- Update driver relationships
- Benchmark against industry

## Integration with Planning

### Fleet Planning
- Input to fleet mix strategy: **01-STRATEGY/FLEET_MIX_STRATEGY.md**
- Inform acquisition and retirement decisions
- Capacity expansion/contraction timing
- Fleet deployment and rebalancing

### Operational Planning
- Schedule development: **[AIRCRAFT_SCHEDULES/](AIRCRAFT_SCHEDULES)**, **[SPACECRAFT_MISSION_PLAN/](SPACECRAFT_MISSION_PLAN)**
- Resource requirements: **03-RESOURCES_OPTIMISATION/**
- Infrastructure planning: Airports, ground stations, facilities

### Financial Planning
- Revenue projections and budgeting
- Capital expenditure planning
- Cost forecasting and management
- Financial scenario analysis

## Best Practices

### Data Quality
- Use multiple data sources for validation
- Clean and normalize historical data
- Document assumptions and adjustments
- Maintain audit trail of changes

### Model Selection
- Use appropriate technique for the problem
- Validate models with out-of-sample testing
- Consider ensemble of models
- Balance complexity and interpretability

### Collaboration
- Engage cross-functional stakeholders
- Reconcile bottom-up and top-down forecasts
- Incorporate market intelligence
- Communicate assumptions and risks

### Documentation
- Document methodology and assumptions
- Provide transparency and rationale
- Version control and change tracking
- Enable reproducibility

## Tools and Systems

### Forecasting Software
- Statistical packages (R, Python, SAS)
