# VALUE_STREAM_COST_MAP.md

## Overview

Value stream mapping is a lean management technique to visualize and analyze the flow of materials, information, and costs through end-to-end processes, identifying waste and optimization opportunities.

## Purpose

- Visualize complete process flows
- Identify value-added and non-value-added activities
- Quantify time, cost, and quality at each step
- Prioritize improvement opportunities
- Design future state with improvements

## Value Stream Mapping Process

### 1. Select Value Stream
- Define scope (process boundaries)
- Identify product/service family
- Determine mapping team

### 2. Map Current State
- Walk the process and observe
- Document each process step
- Capture data (time, cost, quality, inventory)
- Map information and material flows
- Calculate value-add ratio

### 3. Analyze and Identify Waste
- **Overproduction**: Producing more than needed
- **Waiting**: Idle time between steps
- **Transportation**: Unnecessary movement
- **Overprocessing**: Unnecessary process steps
- **Inventory**: Excess work-in-process or stock
- **Motion**: Unnecessary movement of people
- **Defects**: Rework and correction

### 4. Design Future State
- Eliminate waste
- Streamline flow
- Implement pull systems
- Level workload
- Empower workers

### 5. Develop Implementation Plan
- Kaizen events and projects
- Assign ownership and timelines
- Metrics and targets
- Monitor and adjust

## Example Value Streams

### Component Overhaul Process
- Removal from aircraft
- Transportation to shop
- Induction and inspection
- Disassembly and cleaning
- Parts replacement and repair
- Assembly and test
- Quality inspection and release
- Transportation and installation

### Unscheduled Maintenance Event
- Discrepancy detection and reporting
- Troubleshooting and diagnosis
- Parts ordering and expediting
- Maintenance execution
- Inspection and test
- Documentation and release

### Spare Parts Procurement
- Demand identification
- Sourcing and quotation
- Purchase order and approval
- Supplier production and shipment
- Receiving and inspection
- Stocking and deployment

## Cost Mapping

For each process step, capture:
- **Labor cost**: Time Ã— rate
- **Material cost**: Parts and consumables
- **Overhead cost**: Facility, utilities, systems
- **Inventory cost**: Carrying cost of WIP
- **Quality cost**: Inspection, rework, scrap

Calculate:
- **Total process cost**
- **Cost per unit (hour, cycle, part)**
- **Value-add ratio**: Value-add time / total time
- **Cost reduction potential**

## Improvement Opportunities

- Eliminate non-value-added steps
- Reduce cycle time and lead time
- Improve first-pass yield
- Standardize and simplify
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Improve information flow
- Reduce inventory and WIP

## Metrics and Monitoring

- **Cycle time**: Total elapsed time
- **Lead time**: Time from request to delivery
- **Process time**: Actual work time
- **Value-add ratio**: VA time / total time
- **First-pass yield**: % completed without rework
- **Cost per unit**: Total cost / units processed
