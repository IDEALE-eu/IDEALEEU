# MRO Cost Analysis

## Overview

Comprehensive analysis and management of maintenance, repair, and overhaul costs to identify optimization opportunities and drive cost reduction while maintaining safety and reliability.

## Cost Categories

### Direct Maintenance Costs
- **Labor**: Technician time and rates
- **Materials**: Expendable parts and consumables
- **Components**: Rotable overhaul and repair
- **Outside Services**: Contract maintenance and repairs

### Indirect Maintenance Costs
- **Facilities**: Hangars, shops, equipment
- **Tools and GSE**: Ground support equipment
- **IT Systems**: Maintenance management systems
- **Overhead**: Management, quality, engineering support

### Operational Impact
- **AOG Costs**: Lost revenue and recovery costs
- **Delays**: Customer compensation and goodwill
- **Inefficiency**: Suboptimal processes and practices

## Analysis Approach

### Cost Tracking
- Capture costs at detailed level (tail number, ATA chapter, task)
- Allocate indirect costs appropriately
- Track trends over time
- Compare actual vs. budget

### Benchmarking
- Internal comparisons (fleet, station, vendor)
- Industry benchmarks (IATA, associations)
- Identify outliers and best practices
- Set performance targets

### Root Cause Analysis
- High-cost items and trends
- Failure analysis and reliability issues
- Process inefficiencies
- Contract and pricing issues

## Cost Drivers

- Flight hours and cycles (utilization)
- Aircraft age and condition
- Component reliability and life
- Labor rates and productivity
- Parts pricing and availability
- Facility and overhead costs

## Optimization Opportunities

### Preventive vs. Corrective Balance
- Optimize preventive maintenance intervals
- Reduce unscheduled maintenance
- Reliability improvement programs

### Supply Chain Efficiency
- Negotiate better parts pricing
- Optimize inventory levels
- Alternative sources (DER, PMA, surplus)
- Consignment and pooling arrangements

### Process Improvement
- Lean maintenance processes
- Reduce turnaround times
- Improve first-time fix rate
- Better planning and coordination

### Make vs. Buy Decisions
- In-house vs. outsourced maintenance
- Component repair vs. exchange
- Economic repair limits

## Performance Metrics

- **Cost per flight hour**: Total maintenance cost / flight hours
- **Cost per cycle**: For cycle-driven maintenance
- **Labor productivity**: Hours worked / hours charged
- **Material cost ratio**: Materials / total maintenance cost
- **Unscheduled maintenance rate**: Unscheduled events / total maintenance
