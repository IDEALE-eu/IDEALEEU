# 06-COST_OPTIMISATION

MRO cost analysis, warranty management, and value stream optimization.

## Overview

This directory contains cost analysis and optimization programs focused on reducing maintenance, repair, and operations costs while maintaining safety and reliability standards.

## Contents

- **00-README.md** - This file
- **[MRO_COST_ANALYSIS.md](MRO_COST_ANALYSIS.md)** - Maintenance, repair, and overhaul cost tracking and analysis
- **[WARRANTY_CLAIM_TRACKING.md](WARRANTY_CLAIM_TRACKING.md)** - Warranty claim management and recovery
- **[VALUE_STREAM_COST_MAP.md](VALUE_STREAM_COST_MAP.md)** - Value stream mapping for cost reduction opportunities

## Key Functions

### MRO Cost Management
- Track and analyze maintenance costs
- Identify cost drivers and trends
- Benchmark against industry standards
- Implement cost reduction initiatives

### Warranty Management
- Track warranty coverage and claims
- Maximize warranty recovery
- Supplier performance monitoring
- Contract compliance

### Value Stream Optimization
- Map end-to-end processes
- Identify waste and inefficiency
- Implement lean improvements
- Measure cost savings
