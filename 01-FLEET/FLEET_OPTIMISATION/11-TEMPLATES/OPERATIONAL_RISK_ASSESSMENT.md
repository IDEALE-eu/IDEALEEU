- **Risk Category**: [Technical/Operational/Supply Chain/Financial/Strategic/Safety]
- **Risk Description**: [Detailed description of the risk event and potential trigger]

**Example Categories**:
- Technical: Equipment failures, system malfunctions
- Operational: Delays, disruptions, human error
- Supply Chain: Parts shortages, supplier issues
- Financial: Cost overruns, revenue shortfalls
- Strategic: Market changes, regulatory changes
- Safety: Incidents, accidents, security threats

### Risk Owner
- **Primary Owner**: [Name and role responsible for managing risk]
- **Secondary Contacts**: [Supporting team members]

## Risk Analysis

### Likelihood Assessment

Rate the probability of the risk occurring:

| Rating | Description | Probability |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 - Rare | May occur in exceptional circumstances | < 5% |
| 2 - Unlikely | Could occur but not expected | 5-25% |
| 3 - Possible | Might occur occasionally | 25-50% |
| 4 - Likely | Will probably occur | 50-75% |
| 5 - Almost Certain | Expected to occur frequently | > 75% |

**Likelihood Rating**: [1-5]
**Likelihood Justification**: [Explain rating based on history, data, expert judgment]

### Impact Assessment

Rate the consequence if the risk occurs:

| Rating | Safety | Operational | Financial | Reputational |
|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 - Negligible | Minor injury | Minor disruption | < $10K | Minimal impact |
| 2 - Minor | Medical treatment | Hours of delay | $10K-$100K | Local negative press |
| 3 - Moderate | Hospitalization | Days of delay | $100K-$1M | Regional negative press |
| 4 - Major | Permanent disability | Weeks of disruption | $1M-$10M | National negative press |
| 5 - Catastrophic | Fatality | Major capability loss | > $10M | International crisis |

**Impact Rating**: [1-5]
**Impact Category**: [Safety/Operational/Financial/Reputational]
**Impact Justification**: [Explain rating based on potential consequences]

### Risk Score Calculation

```
Risk Score = Likelihood Ã— Impact
```

**Risk Score**: [1-25]

### Risk Priority Matrix

| Risk Score | Priority | Action Required |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 15-25 | Critical | Immediate action, executive attention |
| 10-14 | High | Senior management attention, prompt action |
| 5-9 | Medium | Management responsibility, planned action |
| 1-4 | Low | Routine management, monitor |

**Risk Priority**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]

## Risk Mitigation

### Current Controls
List existing controls and measures already in place:

| Control Type | Control Description | Effectiveness |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Preventive | [Prevents risk from occurring] | [High/Medium/Low] |
| Detective | [Detects risk when it occurs] | [High/Medium/Low] |
| Corrective | [Reduces impact after occurrence] | [High/Medium/Low] |

### Residual Risk Assessment

After considering current controls:
- **Residual Likelihood**: [1-5]
- **Residual Impact**: [1-5]
- **Residual Risk Score**: [1-25]
- **Residual Priority**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]

### Mitigation Strategy

If residual risk is unacceptable, define additional mitigation actions:

| Action ID | Mitigation Action | Action Type | Owner | Target Date | Cost Estimate | Expected Risk Reduction |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|-------|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| A01 | [Specific action to reduce risk] | [Preventive/Detective/Corrective] | [Name] | [Date] | $[Amount] | [Likelihood/Impact reduction] |

**Action Types**:
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk by not performing the activity
- **Reduce**: Implement controls to lower likelihood or impact
- **Transfer**: Shift risk to another party (insurance, contract)
- **Accept**: Acknowledge risk and prepare contingency response

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Mitigation Option | Implementation Cost | Expected Benefit | NPV | ROI | Recommendation |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----|-----|----------------|
| Option 1 | $[Cost] | [Risk reduction quantified] | $[NPV] | [%] | [Proceed/Reject] |

## Monitoring and Review

### Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
Define measurable indicators that signal increasing risk:

| KRI | Threshold | Monitoring Frequency | Data Source | Escalation Trigger |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Metric] | [Warning level] | [Daily/Weekly/Monthly] | [System/Report] | [When to alert] |

### Review Schedule
- **Routine Review**: [Quarterly/Semi-Annual/Annual]
- **Trigger for Ad-Hoc Review**: [Events that require reassessment]
- **Review Participants**: [Roles involved in review]

### Change Log

| Date | Change Description | Changed By | Reason |
|------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| [Date] | [What changed in assessment] | [Name] | [Why change was made] |

## Risk Response Plan

### Contingency Plan
If the risk materializes, what is the response?

**Activation Triggers**: [Conditions that activate response]

**Response Actions**:
1. [Immediate action step 1]
2. [Immediate action step 2]
3. [Follow-up action step 3]

**Resources Required**: [People, equipment, budget]

**Communication Plan**: [Who to notify, when, and how]

**Recovery Strategy**: [How to restore normal operations]

## Risk Assessment Approval

| Role | Name | Signature | Date |
|------|------|-----------|------|
| Risk Owner | | | |
| Department Manager | | | |
| Risk Manager | | | |
| Senior Leadership | | | |
