# PREDICTIVE_MAINTENANCE_MODELS

Condition-based and predictive maintenance models using data analytics and AI/ML.

## Overview

Predictive maintenance leverages operational data, sensor information, and advanced analytics to predict component failures and optimize maintenance timing, reducing unscheduled maintenance and improving fleet availability.

## Key Capabilities

- **Condition Monitoring**: Real-time health assessment
- **Prognostics**: Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction
- **Anomaly Detection**: Early warning of degradation
- **Optimization**: Optimal maintenance timing

## Technologies

- Time series analysis
- Machine learning (supervised, unsupervised)
- Physics-based models
- Hybrid approaches
