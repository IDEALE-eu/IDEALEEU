# RELIABILITY_CENTRED_MAINTENANCE

Reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) analysis and maintenance task development.

## Overview

RCM is a systematic approach to determining the most effective maintenance strategies for complex systems based on reliability analysis, failure mode identification, and consequence assessment.

## RCM Process

### 1. System Selection and Boundary Definition
### 2. Functional Failure Analysis
### 3. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
### 4. Consequence Classification
### 5. Task Selection and Optimization
### 6. Program Implementation and Review

For detailed methodology, see **11-TEMPLATES/RCM_ANALYSIS_WORKSHEET.md**
