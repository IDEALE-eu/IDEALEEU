# Maintenance Program

## Overview

The maintenance program defines all required maintenance activities, intervals, and standards to ensure continued airworthiness, safety, and reliability of the fleet throughout its operational life.

## Program Structure

### Regulatory Framework
- Airworthiness regulations (FAA Part 121/135, EASA Part-M)
- Type certificate data sheet (TCDS) requirements
- Airworthiness directives (ADs) compliance
- Service bulletins and manufacturer recommendations
- Supplemental type certificate (STC) requirements

### Maintenance Organization
- **Line Maintenance**: Daily and weekly checks, minor repairs
- **Base Maintenance**: Heavy checks, major inspections, modifications
- **Component Maintenance**: Overhaul shops for rotables
- **Engineering Support**: Technical authority and troubleshooting

## Maintenance Check Types

### Aircraft Maintenance

#### Line Maintenance
- **Daily/Preflight Check**: Visual inspection, servicing
- **A Check** (±300-500 flight hours): Detailed visual inspections, operational tests
  - Duration: 10-20 hours
  - Location: Line maintenance station
  
#### Base Maintenance
- **B Check** (±4-6 months): More detailed inspections, some component removal
  - Duration: 1-3 days
  - Discontinued in some programs (tasks rolled into A or C checks)

- **C Check** (±18-24 months or 3000-6000 flight hours): Major inspection
  - Duration: 1-2 weeks
  - Access panels removed, detailed NDT inspections
  - Structural inspections, system functional tests
  - Aircraft typically in hangar

- **D Check** (±6-10 years): Major structural inspection and overhaul
  - Duration: 4-8 weeks
  - Aircraft essentially disassembled and reassembled
  - Structural and corrosion inspections
  - Major component overhauls
  - Heavy maintenance facility required

#### Engine and Component Overhaul
- Time or cycle-based intervals (e.g., 20,000 hours or 30,000 cycles)
- On-condition monitoring programs
- Modular overhaul approach
- Shop visit planning and core rotable pool management

### Spacecraft Maintenance

#### Pre-Launch Processing
- Assembly, integration, and test (AIT)
- System functional tests and validation
- Fueling and final preparations
- Quality inspections and acceptance

#### On-Orbit Maintenance (if applicable)
- Autonomous health monitoring
- Ground-commanded diagnostics
- Software updates and patches
- Contingency recovery procedures

#### Post-Mission Processing
- Recovery and safing procedures
- Inspection and damage assessment
- Refurbishment for reuse (reusable vehicles)
- Component replacement and upgrades

## Maintenance Planning

### Task Development
- Identify maintenance tasks from RCM analysis: **RELIABILITY_CENTRED_MAINTENANCE/**
- Define task intervals and thresholds
- Specify task procedures and standards
- Determine resource requirements (time, labor, parts, tools)

### Interval Optimization
- Balance safety, reliability, and cost
- Statistical analysis of component life and failure rates
- Escalation factors for age-related issues
- Regulatory compliance and approval

### Scheduling
- Long-term maintenance planning (annual, multi-year)
- Coordinate with operational schedules: **02-DEMAND_PLANNING/**
- Optimize utilization and minimize downtime
- Resource leveling and capacity management

## Airworthiness Directives and Service Bulletins

### Airworthiness Directives (ADs)
- **Emergency ADs**: Immediate compliance, safety-critical
- **Mandatory ADs**: Compliance within specified timeframe
- **Repetitive ADs**: Recurring inspections or actions
- Tracking and compliance management

### Service Bulletins (SBs)
- Manufacturer recommendations for improvements
- Optional unless made mandatory by AD or operator
- Alert service bulletins (ASB) for safety-related
- Cost-benefit analysis for incorporation

## Condition Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
- Engine condition monitoring (vibration, oil analysis, performance)
- Structural health monitoring (strain, fatigue, corrosion)
- Systems health (avionics, hydraulics, electrical)
- Predictive models: **PREDICTIVE_MAINTENANCE_MODELS/**

### Data-Driven Maintenance
- Analyze operational data from **OPERATIONAL_DATA_HUB/**
- Trend monitoring and anomaly detection
- Prognostics and health management (PHM)
- Optimize maintenance timing based on actual condition

## Maintenance Execution

### Work Planning
- Detailed work packages and task cards
- Materials and tooling requirements
- Manpower and skill requirements
- Schedule and sequence of tasks

### Work Control
- Task tracking and status updates
- Discrepancy management and resolution
- Quality inspections and acceptance
- Recordkeeping and documentation

### Performance Monitoring
- Schedule adherence and on-time completion
- Work quality and defect rates
- Resource utilization and productivity
- Cost tracking and variance analysis

## Continuous Improvement

### Reliability Monitoring
- In-service reliability data collection
- Failure analysis and root cause investigation
- Maintenance steering group (MSG) reviews
- Program adjustments and optimization

### Aging Aircraft Programs
- Structural integrity and fatigue monitoring
- Corrosion prevention and control programs (CPCP)
- Life extension analysis and modifications
- Economic life determination

## Compliance and Auditing

### Internal Audits
- Maintenance program compliance audits
- Quality assurance and quality control
- Corrective action tracking
- Continuous monitoring

### Regulatory Oversight
- Authority inspections and audits
- Findings and corrective actions
- Regulatory reporting requirements
- Certificate maintenance

## Integration

### Operational Integration
- Coordinate with flight/mission schedules
- Minimize impact on operational availability
- Emergency and unscheduled maintenance response

### Resource Integration
- Spares planning: **SPARES_INVENTORY_OPTIMISATION/**
- Technician scheduling: **GROUND_CREW_ROSTERING/**
- Facility and infrastructure: **INFRASTRUCTURE_UTILISATION/**

### Data Integration
- Maintenance management systems (MMS)
- Operational data from **OPERATIONAL_DATA_HUB/**
- Configuration management: **00-PROGRAM/CONFIG_MGMT/**
