[‚Üê Back to FLEET_OPTIMISATION](../00-README.md)

Maintenance programs, reliability-centered maintenance, predictive models, and technical logistics.

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive maintenance planning systems and processes that ensure fleet airworthiness, reliability, and availability through optimized maintenance strategies, predictive technologies, and efficient logistics support.

## Contents

- **00-README.md** - This file
- **[MAINTENANCE_PROGRAM.md](MAINTENANCE_PROGRAM.md)** - Overall maintenance program structure and schedules
- **[RELIABILITY_CENTRED_MAINTENANCE/](RELIABILITY_CENTRED_MAINTENANCE/)** - RCM analysis and task development
- **[PREDICTIVE_MAINTENANCE_MODELS/](PREDICTIVE_MAINTENANCE_MODELS/)** - Condition-based and predictive maintenance systems
- **[TECHNICAL_LOGISTICS_SUPPORT/](TECHNICAL_LOGISTICS_SUPPORT/)** - Technical publications, logistics, and support systems

## Key Functions

### Maintenance Program Development
- Define maintenance intervals and tasks
- Align with regulatory requirements (airworthiness, safety)
- Optimize reliability and cost-effectiveness
- Continuous improvement based on operational data

### Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM)
- Systematic analysis of failure modes and effects
- Determine appropriate maintenance tasks
- Balance preventive and predictive approaches
- Optimize maintenance intervals

### Predictive Maintenance
- Condition monitoring and health tracking
- Prognostics and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction
- AI/ML models for failure prediction
- Optimize maintenance timing and reduce unscheduled events

### Technical Logistics Support
- Technical publications and documentation
- Maintenance planning and control systems
- Tooling and ground support equipment
- Training and competency management

## Integration

### Upstream Inputs
- Operational data: **[01-FLEET/OPERATIONAL_DATA_HUB/](../../OPERATIONAL_DATA_HUB/)**
- Fleet strategy: **[01-STRATEGY/](../01-STRATEGY/)**
- Resource availability: **[03-RESOURCES_OPTIMISATION/](../03-RESOURCES_OPTIMISATION/)**
- MRO strategy: **[01-FLEET/MRO_STRATEGY/](../../MRO_STRATEGY/)**

### Downstream Outputs
- Maintenance schedules for execution
- Spare parts requirements: **[SPARES_INVENTORY_OPTIMISATION/](../03-RESOURCES_OPTIMISATION/SPARES_INVENTORY_OPTIMISATION/)**
- Resource needs: **[CREW_SCHEDULING/](../03-RESOURCES_OPTIMISATION/CREW_SCHEDULING/)**, **[INFRASTRUCTURE_UTILISATION/](../03-RESOURCES_OPTIMISATION/INFRASTRUCTURE_UTILISATION/)**
- Availability projections: **[05-OPERATIONAL_PERFORMANCE/](../05-OPERATIONAL_PERFORMANCE/)**
- Cost estimates: **[06-COST_OPTIMISATION/](../06-COST_OPTIMISATION/)**

## Key Deliverables

1. **Maintenance Program Manual** - Comprehensive maintenance requirements and schedules
2. **RCM Analysis Reports** - Failure mode analysis and maintenance task determination
3. **Predictive Models** - Health monitoring and prognostic algorithms
4. **Maintenance Plans** - Scheduled and forecast maintenance activities
5. **Technical Support Documentation** - Procedures, publications, and training materials
