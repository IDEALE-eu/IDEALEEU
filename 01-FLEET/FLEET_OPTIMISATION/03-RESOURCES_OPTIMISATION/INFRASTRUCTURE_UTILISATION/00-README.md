### Efficiency
- **Average taxi time**: Gate to runway and runway to gate
- **Turnaround time**: Gate arrival to departure
- **Connection success rate**: Percentage of successful transfers
- **Launch campaign duration**: Facility occupancy per mission

### Financial
- **Cost per gate hour**: Lease or ownership cost
- **Revenue per gate**: Aircraft utilization and traffic
- **Facility ROI**: Return on infrastructure investment
- **Opportunity cost**: Lost revenue due to constraints

### Operational
