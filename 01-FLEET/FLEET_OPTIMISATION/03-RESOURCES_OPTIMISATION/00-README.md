# 03-RESOURCES_OPTIMISATION

Optimization of crew, ground resources, infrastructure, and spares inventory.

## Overview

This directory contains systems and processes for optimizing the allocation and utilization of operational resources including flight and mission crews, ground personnel, infrastructure assets, and spare parts inventory to maximize efficiency while ensuring operational readiness.

## Contents

- **00-README.md** - This file
- **CREW_SCHEDULING/** - Flight crew and mission operations crew scheduling and rostering
- **GROUND_CREW_ROSTERING/** - Ground handling, maintenance, and support crew scheduling
- **INFRASTRUCTURE_UTILISATION/** - Airport gates, hangars, ground stations, launch facilities optimization
- **SPARES_INVENTORY_OPTIMISATION/** - Spare parts positioning, inventory levels, and logistics

## Key Functions

### Crew Resource Management
- Crew pairing and rostering optimization
- Qualification and currency tracking
- Duty time and fatigue management
- Training and proficiency planning
- Reserve and standby crew allocation

### Ground Resource Management
- Ground crew shift planning and optimization
- Skill mix and qualification management
- Peak period capacity planning
- Cross-utilization and flexibility

### Infrastructure Optimization
- Gate and stand allocation
- Hangar and facility utilization
- Ground station and tracking network scheduling
- Launch pad and range scheduling
- Capacity planning and bottleneck management

### Spares Inventory Management
- Optimal inventory levels and safety stock
- Geographic positioning and pooling
- Reorder points and replenishment
- Rotable component management
- Spare parts logistics and distribution

## Optimization Objectives

### Operational Excellence
- Ensure resource availability for all scheduled operations
- Minimize delays and disruptions due to resource constraints
- Maintain safety and compliance standards
- Provide operational flexibility and resilience

### Cost Efficiency

- Optimize staffing levels and labor costs
- Reduce inventory carrying costs
- Maximize asset utilization and ROI

### Employee Satisfaction
- Ensure work-life balance and quality of life
- Provide schedule stability and predictability
- Equitable workload distribution
- Career development and training opportunities

## Integration

### Upstream Inputs
- Operational schedules from **02-DEMAND_PLANNING/**
- Fleet availability from **01-STRATEGY/** and **04-MAINTENANCE_PLANNING/**
